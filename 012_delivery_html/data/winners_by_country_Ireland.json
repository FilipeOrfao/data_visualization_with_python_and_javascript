In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director.

They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/More_Pricks_than_Kicks\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"More Pricks than Kicks\">More Pricks than Kicks<\/a><\/i> (1934) afford a representative sample of this style:\n<\/p><p>The passage makes reference to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dante_Alighieri\" title=\"Dante Alighieri\">Dante<\/a>'s <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Divine_Comedy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Divine Comedy\">Commedia<\/a><\/i>, which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.\n<\/p><p>Similar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, <i>Murphy<\/i> (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Black_comedy\" title=\"Black comedy\">black<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gallows_humor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gallows humor\">humour<\/a> that animate many of Beckett's works: \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup> <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Watt_(novel)\" title=\"Watt (novel)\">Watt<\/a><\/i>, written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II,<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">[45]<\/a><\/sup> is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Permutation\" title=\"Permutation\">mathematical permutation<\/a>, presaging Beckett's later preoccupation\u2014in both his novels and dramatic works\u2014with precise movement.\n<\/p><p>Beckett's 1930 essay <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Proust_(Beckett_essay)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Proust (Beckett essay)\">Proust<\/a><\/i> was strongly influenced by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arthur_Schopenhauer\" title=\"Arthur Schopenhauer\">Schopenhauer<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/wiki\/Philosophical_pessimism\" title=\"Philosophical pessimism\">pessimism<\/a> and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness\u2014in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in <i>Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates<\/i> (1935)\u2014seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Watt_(novel)\" title=\"Watt (novel)\">Watt<\/a><\/i>.\n<\/p><p>After World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the \"revelation\" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin\u2014in which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world\u2014that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.\n<\/p><p>During the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: <i>En attendant Godot<\/i> (written 1948\u20131949; <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Waiting_for_Godot\" title=\"Waiting for Godot\">Waiting for Godot<\/a><\/i>), <i>Fin de partie<\/i> (1955\u20131957; <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Endgame_(play)\" title=\"Endgame (play)\">Endgame<\/a><\/i>), <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Krapp%27s_Last_Tape\" title=\"Krapp's Last Tape\">Krapp's Last Tape<\/a><\/i> (1958), and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Happy_Days_(play)\" title=\"Happy Days (play)\">Happy Days<\/a><\/i> (1961). These plays\u2014which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Theatre_of_the_Absurd\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Theatre of the Absurd\">Theatre of the Absurd<\/a>\"\u2014deal in a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Black_comedy\" title=\"Black comedy\">darkly humorous<\/a> way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary <a href=\"\/wiki\/Existentialism\" title=\"Existentialism\">existentialist thinkers<\/a>. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and <i>Godot<\/i> were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Albert_Camus\" title=\"Albert Camus\">Albert Camus<\/a>'s concept of \"the absurd\";<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">[47]<\/a><\/sup> this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded <a href=\"\/wiki\/Absurdism\" title=\"Absurdism\">his own philosophy<\/a>). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.<sup id=\"cite_ref-48\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-48\">[48]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Broadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell\u2014one of the two characters in <i>Endgame<\/i> who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak\u2014can best summarise the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">[49]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Beckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels <a href=\"\/wiki\/Molloy_(novel)\" title=\"Molloy (novel)\"><i>Molloy<\/i><\/a> (1951), <i>Malone meurt<\/i> (1951; <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Malone_Dies\" title=\"Malone Dies\">Malone Dies<\/a><\/i>) and <i>L'innommable<\/i> (1953: <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Unnamable_(novel)\" title=\"The Unnamable (novel)\">The Unnamable<\/a><\/i>). In these novels\u2014sometimes referred to as a \"trilogy\", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes\u2014the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">[50]<\/a><\/sup> <i>Molloy<\/i>, for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Detective_novel\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Detective novel\">detective novel<\/a>. In <i>Malone Dies<\/i>, movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the \"action\" of the book takes the form of an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Inner_monologue\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Inner monologue\">interior monologue<\/a>. Finally, in <i>The Unnamable<\/i>, almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of <i>The Unnamable<\/i>: \"you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">[51]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>After these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief \"stories\" later collected as <i>Texts for Nothing<\/i>. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, <i>Comment c'est<\/i> (1961; <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/How_It_Is\" title=\"How It Is\">How It Is<\/a><\/i>). An early variant version of <i>Comment c'est<\/i>, <i>L'Image<\/i>, was published in the British arts review, <a href=\"\/wiki\/X_(magazine)\" title=\"X (magazine)\"><i>X: A Quarterly Review<\/i><\/a> (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">[52]<\/a><\/sup> This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food.

This has led to his work sometimes being described as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Minimalism\" title=\"Minimalism\">minimalist<\/a>. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Breath_(play)\" title=\"Breath (play)\">Breath<\/a><\/i>, which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Oh!_Calcutta!\" title=\"Oh! Calcutta!\">Oh! Calcutta!<\/a><\/i>, the theatrical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Revue\" title=\"Revue\">revue<\/a> for which it served as an introductory piece).<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">[54]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters\u2014already few in number in the earlier plays\u2014are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Play_(play)\" title=\"Play (play)\">Play<\/a><\/i> (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Eh_Joe\" title=\"Eh Joe\">Eh Joe<\/a><\/i> (1963), which was written for the actor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jack_MacGowran\" title=\"Jack MacGowran\">Jack MacGowran<\/a>, is animated by a camera that steadily closes into a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Not_I\" title=\"Not I\">Not I<\/a><\/i> (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, \"a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-55\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-55\">[55]<\/a><\/sup> Following from <i>Krapp's Last Tape<\/i>, many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in <i>Eh Joe<\/i>) or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in <i>Not I<\/i>). Beckett's most politically charged play, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Catastrophe_(play)\" title=\"Catastrophe (play)\">Catastrophe<\/a><\/i> (1982), which was dedicated to <a href=\"\/wiki\/V%C3%A1clav_Havel\" title=\"V\u00e1clav Havel\">V\u00e1clav Havel<\/a>, deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of <i>mirlitonnades<\/i>, with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Derek_Mahon\" title=\"Derek Mahon\">Derek Mahon<\/a>, have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.\n<\/p><p>Beckett's late style saw him experiment with technology to create increasingly transdisciplinary works. This sampling of a range of artistic mediums and styles \u2013 classical music, painting, sculpture, television, and literature \u2013 to create a new and original form, or genre, is evident in his television plays. In works like <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Ghost_Trio_(play)\" title=\"Ghost Trio (play)\">Ghost Trio<\/a><\/i> (broadcast in 1977) and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Nacht_und_Tr%C3%A4ume_(play)\" title=\"Nacht und Tr\u00e4ume (play)\">Nacht und Tr\u00e4ume<\/a><\/i> (broadcast in 1983) Beckett uses a musical frame (taking excerpts from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ludwig_van_Beethoven\" title=\"Ludwig van Beethoven\">Beethoven<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Franz_Schubert\" title=\"Franz Schubert\">Schubert<\/a>, respectively) to structure his text and borrows well-known images from art history to create evocative stills that suggest themes of longing, ambiguity, hope, and suffering. Such experimentation with genre, music, and the visual arts, characterises Beckett's work during the 1970s and '80s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">[56]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Beckett's prose pieces during the late period were not as prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts <i>Fizzles<\/i> (which the American artist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jasper_Johns\" title=\"Jasper Johns\">Jasper Johns<\/a> illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Company_(short_story)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Company (short story)\">Company<\/a><\/i> (1980), which continued with <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Ill_Seen_Ill_Said\" title=\"Ill Seen Ill Said\">Ill Seen Ill Said<\/a><\/i> (1982) and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Worstward_Ho\" title=\"Worstward Ho\">Worstward Ho<\/a><\/i> (1983), later collected in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Nohow_On\" title=\"Nohow On\">Nohow On<\/a><\/i>.
