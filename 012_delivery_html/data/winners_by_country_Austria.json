The many aspects of this question are what the second Hague Conference should be discussing rather than the proposed topics concerning the laws and practices of war at sea, the bombardment of ports, towns, and villages, the laying of mines, and so on.

In addition, Suttner often worked as a journalist to publicise her message or promote her own books, events, and causes.\n<\/p><p>As Tolstoy noted and others have since agreed, there is a strong similarity between Suttner and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe\" title=\"Harriet Beecher Stowe\">Harriet Beecher Stowe<\/a>.

Two common issues in her work, apart from pacifism, are religion and gender.\n<\/p><p>There are two main issues with religion that Suttner often wrote about. She had a disdain for the spectacle and pomp of some religious practices. In a scene in <i>Lay Down Your Arms<\/i> she highlighted the odd theatricality of some religious practices. In the scene, the emperor and empress are washing the feet of normal citizens to show they are as humble as Jesus, but they invite everyone to witness their show of humility and enter the hall in a dramatic fashion. The protagonist Martha remarks that it was \"indeed a sham washing.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_40-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-40\">[40]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Another issue prominent in much of her writing is the idea that war is righteously for <a href=\"\/wiki\/God\" title=\"God\">God<\/a>, and leaders often use religion as a pretext for war. Suttner criticised this reasoning on the grounds that it placed the state as the important entity to God rather than the individual, thereby making dying in battle more glorious than other forms of death or surviving a war. Much of <i>Lay Down Your Arms<\/i> discusses this topic.\n<\/p><p>This type of religious thinking also leads to segregation and fighting based on religious differences, which Bertha and Arthur von Suttner refused to accept. As a devout <a href=\"\/wiki\/Christian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Christian\">Christian<\/a>, Arthur founded the League Against Anti-Semitism in response to the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the growing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antisemitism\" title=\"Antisemitism\">antisemitism<\/a> across Europe.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">[41]<\/a><\/sup> The Suttner family called for acceptance of all people and all faiths, with Suttner writing in her memoirs that \"religion was neighbourly love, not neighbourly hatred.

She was an outspoken leader in a society in which women were to be seen, not be heard. But she did not actively participate in the movements for women\u2019s suffrage, for instance, which she explained due to  a lack of time. She instead focused on reaching out to other women in the international peace movement, though she kept close contact to the women\u2019s <a href=\"\/wiki\/Suffrage_movement\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Suffrage movement\">suffrage movement<\/a>.

Von Suttner knew, though, that conflict can only be avoided if both men and women together struggle for peace, which required an absolute belief in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gender_equality\" title=\"Gender equality\">gender equality<\/a>. \"The tasks involved in mankind's continuing ennoblement are such that they can only be fulfilled through fair and equal cooperation between the sexes\", she wrote.<sup id=\"cite_ref-asser_35-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-asser-35\">[35]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Die_Waffen_nieder!\" title=\"Die Waffen nieder!\">Lay Down Your Arms<\/a><\/i>, the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue.

These donor-recipient relationships arise due to the fact that type O-negative blood possesses neither antigens of blood group A nor of blood group B. Therefore, the immune systems of persons with blood group A, B or AB do not refuse the donation. Further, because persons with blood group AB do not form antibodies against either the antigens of blood group A or B, they can accept red blood cells from persons with these blood groups, as well as from persons with blood group O-negative.\n<\/p><p>In 1930 Landsteiner was awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine<\/a> in recognition of these achievements.

Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Psychology_and_Alchemy\" title=\"Psychology and Alchemy\">Psychology and Alchemy<\/a><\/i>. In 1933 Pauli published the second part of his book on Physics, <i>Handbuch der Physik<\/i>, which was considered the definitive book on the new field of quantum physics. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Oppenheimer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Oppenheimer\">Robert Oppenheimer<\/a> called it \"the only adult introduction to quantum mechanics.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anschluss\" title=\"Anschluss\">German annexation of Austria in 1938<\/a> made Pauli a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 after World War II broke out.

Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. In 1921 Pauli worked with Bohr to create the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aufbau_Principle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aufbau Principle\">Aufbau Principle<\/a>, which described building up electrons in shells based on the German word for building up, as Bohr was also fluent in German.\n<\/p><p>Pauli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_number\" title=\"Quantum number\">quantum number<\/a>) with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics.

He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it <i>ganz falsch<\/i>, \"utterly wrong\".\n<\/p><p>But this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such.

He dissected out of frogs two beating <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heart\" title=\"Heart\">hearts<\/a>: one with the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vagus_nerve\" title=\"Vagus nerve\">vagus nerve<\/a> which controls heart rate attached, the other heart on its own. Both hearts were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first heart beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first heart and applied it to the second heart. The application of the liquid made the second heart also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the heart rate. He called the unknown chemical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vagusstoff\" title=\"Vagusstoff\">Vagusstoff<\/a>, naming it after the nerve and the German word for substance. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Acetylcholine\" title=\"Acetylcholine\">acetylcholine<\/a>. His experiment was iconic because it was the first to demonstrate the endogenous release of a chemical substance that could cause a response in the absence of electrical stimulation. It paved the way for the understanding that the electrical signaling event (action potential) causes a chemical event (release of neurotransmitter from synapses) that is ultimately the effector on the tissue.\n<\/p><p>Loewi's investigations \"On an augmentation of adrenaline release by cocaine\" and \"On the connection between digitalis and the action of calcium\" stimulated a considerable body of research in the years following their publication.\n<\/p><p>He also clarified two mechanisms of therapeutic importance: the blockade and the augmentation of nerve action by certain drugs.\n<\/p><p>Loewi is also known for the means by which the idea for his experiment came to him. On Easter Saturday 1921, he dreamed of an experiment that would prove once and for all that transmission of nerve impulses was chemical, not electrical. He woke up, scribbled the experiment onto a scrap of paper on his night-stand, and went back to sleep.\n<\/p><p>The next morning, he found, to his horror, that he couldn't read his midnight scribbles. That day, he said, was the longest day of his life, as he could not remember his dream. That night, however, he had the same dream.

For many years, scientists had been puzzled by the levels of ionizing radiation measured in the atmosphere. The assumption at the time was that the radiation would decrease as the distance from the earth, the then assumed source of the radiation, increased. The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Electroscope\" title=\"Electroscope\">electroscopes<\/a> previously used gave an approximate measurement of the radiation but indicated that at greater altitude in the atmosphere the level of radiation might actually be higher than that on the ground. Hess approached this mystery first by greatly increasing the precision of the measuring equipment, and then by personally taking the equipment aloft in a balloon. He systematically measured the radiation at altitudes up to 5.3 kilometres (3.3\u00a0mi) during 1911\u20131912.

Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic and free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be \"a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Individualism_and_economic_order_173-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Individualism_and_economic_order-173\">[173]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>He discusses the contrasting traditions of liberty\u2014British and French\u2014in the theory of freedom. The British tradition, influenced by thinkers like David Hume and Adam Smith, emphasizes the organic growth of institutions and the spontaneous evolution of society. It recognizes that political order arises from the cumulative experience and success of individuals, rather than from deliberate design. In contrast, the French tradition, rooted in Cartesian rationalism, seeks to construct a utopia based on a belief in the unlimited powers of human reason. The French tradition, that Hayek called constructivist rationalism, gained influence over time, partly due to its assumptions about human ambition and pride. However, according to Hayek, the British tradition, with its emphasis on the gradual development of civilization and the role of individual freedom, provides a more valid theory of liberty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Individualism_and_economic_order_173-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Individualism_and_economic_order-173\">[173]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-174\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-174\">[174]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-175\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-175\">[175]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Hayek viewed the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_price_system\" title=\"Free price system\">free price system<\/a> not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spontaneous_order\" title=\"Spontaneous order\">spontaneous order<\/a> or what Scottish philosopher <a href=\"\/wiki\/Adam_Ferguson\" title=\"Adam Ferguson\">Adam Ferguson<\/a> referred to as \"the result of human action but not of human design\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Ferguson1767_176-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Ferguson1767-176\">[176]<\/a><\/sup> For instance, Hayek put the price mechanism on the same level as language, which he developed in his price signal theory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-177\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-177\">[177]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Hayek attributed the birth of civilisation to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Private_property\" title=\"Private property\">private property<\/a> in his book <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Fatal_Conceit\" title=\"The Fatal Conceit\">The Fatal Conceit<\/a><\/i> (1988).<sup id=\"cite_ref-:18_178-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:18-178\">[178]<\/a><\/sup> He explained that <a href=\"\/wiki\/Price_signals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Price signals\">price signals<\/a> are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tacit_knowledge\" title=\"Tacit knowledge\">tacit knowledge<\/a> or <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dispersed_knowledge\" title=\"Dispersed knowledge\">dispersed knowledge<\/a> to each other to solve the economic calculation problem.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:18_178-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:18-178\">[178]<\/a><\/sup> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alain_de_Benoist\" title=\"Alain de Benoist\">Alain de Benoist<\/a> of the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Nouvelle_Droite\" title=\"Nouvelle Droite\">Nouvelle Droite<\/a><\/i> (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek's work in an issue of <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Telos_(journal)\" title=\"Telos (journal)\">Telos<\/a><\/i>, citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek's idea of \"spontaneous order\" and the authoritarian and totalising implications of his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_market\" title=\"Free market\">free-market<\/a> ideology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-179\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-179\">[179]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Hayek's concept of the market as a spontaneous order has been applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-180\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-180\">[180]<\/a><\/sup> Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind.<sup id=\"cite_ref-181\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-181\">[181]<\/a><\/sup> On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements.
