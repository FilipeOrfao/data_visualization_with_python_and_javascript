Despite the financial problems caused by Emelina later on, Mistral held great respect for her. Her father, Juan Ger\u00f3nimo Godoy Villanueva, was also a schoolteacher but left the family when she was three years old and died alone and estranged in 1911. Poverty was a constant presence in her early life. At the age of fifteen, she supported herself and her mother, Petronila Alcayaga, a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dressmaker\" title=\"Dressmaker\">seamstress<\/a>, by working as a teacher's aide in Compa\u00f1\u00eda Baja, a seaside town near <a href=\"\/wiki\/La_Serena,_Chile\" title=\"La Serena, Chile\">La Serena<\/a>, Chile.\n<\/p><p>In 1904, Mistral published some early poems, including <i>Enso\u00f1aciones<\/i> (\"Dreams\"), <i>Carta \u00cdntima<\/i> (\"Intimate Letter\"), and <i>Junto al Mar<\/i> (\"By the Sea\"), in the local newspapers <i>El Coquimbo: Diario Radical<\/i> and <i>La Voz de Elqui<\/i>, using different pseudonyms and variations of her name.\n<\/p><p>In 1906, Mistral met Romelio Ureta, a railway worker and her first love, who tragically took his own life in 1909.<sup id=\"cite_ref-nobel_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobel-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> Shortly after, her second love married someone else. These heartbreaks were reflected in her early poetry and gained recognition with her first published literary work in 1914, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Sonetos_de_la_Muerte\" title=\"Sonetos de la Muerte\">Sonetos de la muerte<\/a><\/i> (\"Sonnets on Death\"). To protect her job as a teacher, she used a pen name, fearing the consequences of revealing her true identity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> Mistral won first prize in the national literary contest <a href=\"\/wiki\/Floral_Games\" title=\"Floral Games\">Juegos Florales<\/a> held in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Santiago\" title=\"Santiago\">Santiago<\/a>, the capital of Chile. Exploring themes of death and life more broadly than previous <a href=\"\/wiki\/Latin_American_poetry\" title=\"Latin American poetry\">Latin American poets<\/a>, she expanded her poetic horizons. While Mistral had passionate friendships with both men and women, which influenced her writing, she kept her emotional life private.\n<\/p><p>Since June 1908, Mistral had been using the pen name Gabriela Mistral for most of her writing. After winning the Juegos Florales, she rarely used her given name, Lucila Godoy, for her publications. She constructed her pseudonym from the names of two of her favorite poets, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gabriele_D%27Annunzio\" title=\"Gabriele D'Annunzio\">Gabriele D'Annunzio<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Mistral\" title=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral<\/a>, or, according to another account, as a combination of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gabriel\" title=\"Gabriel\">Archangel Gabriel<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mistral_(wind)\" title=\"Mistral (wind)\">mistral wind<\/a> of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Provence\" title=\"Provence\">Provence<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1922, Mistral published her debut book, <i>Desolaci\u00f3n<\/i> (\"Desolation\"),<sup id=\"cite_ref-nobel_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobel-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> with assistance from Federico de Onis, the Director of the Hispanic Institute of New York. The collection of poems explored themes such as motherhood, religion, nature, morality, and love for children. Her personal sorrows were reflected in the poems, solidifying her international reputation. Departing from the modernist trends in Latin America, Mistral's work was hailed by critics as straightforward yet simplistic. Two years later, in 1924, she released her second book, <i>Ternura<\/i> (\"Tenderness\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-nobel_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobel-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>During her adolescence, the scarcity of trained teachers, especially in rural areas, allowed anyone willing to work to find employment as a teacher. However, the young woman faced challenges in accessing good schools due to her lack of political and social connections. In 1907, she was rejected from the Normal School without explanation, which she later attributed to the school's chaplain, Father Ignacio Munizaga, who was aware of her publications advocating for educational reform and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Universal_access_to_education\" title=\"Universal access to education\">increased access to schools<\/a> for all social classes.\n<\/p><p>Although her formal education ended in 1900, she secured teaching positions with the help of her older sister, Emelina, who had likewise begun as a teacher's aide and was responsible for much of the poet's early education. Through her publications in local and national newspapers and magazines, as well as her willingness to relocate, she advanced from one teaching position to another. Between 1906 and 1912, she taught at several schools near La Serena, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Barrancas,_Pichilemu\" title=\"Barrancas, Pichilemu\">Barrancas<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Traigu%C3%A9n\" title=\"Traigu\u00e9n\">Traigu\u00e9n<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antofagasta\" title=\"Antofagasta\">Antofagasta<\/a>. In 1912, she began working at a liceo (high school) in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Los_Andes,_Chile\" title=\"Los Andes, Chile\">Los Andes<\/a>, where she remained for six years, frequently visiting Santiago. In 1918, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pedro_Aguirre_Cerda\" title=\"Pedro Aguirre Cerda\">Pedro Aguirre Cerda<\/a>, the Minister of Education and future <a href=\"\/wiki\/President_of_Chile\" title=\"President of Chile\">President of Chile<\/a>, appointed her as the director of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sara_Braun\" title=\"Sara Braun\">Sara Braun<\/a> Lyceum in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Punta_Arenas\" title=\"Punta Arenas\">Punta Arenas<\/a>. She subsequently moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Temuco\" title=\"Temuco\">Temuco<\/a> in 1920 and then to Santiago in 1921, defeating a candidate associated with the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Radical_Party_of_Chile\" title=\"Radical Party of Chile\">Radical Party<\/a> to become the director of Santiago's Liceo #6, the country's newest and most prestigious girls' school.\n<\/p><p>The controversy surrounding Gabriela Mistral's nomination for the coveted position in Santiago influenced her decision to accept an invitation to work in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mexico\" title=\"Mexico\">Mexico<\/a> in 1922, under the guidance of Mexico's Minister of Education, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jos%C3%A9_Vasconcelos\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos\">Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos<\/a>. There, she contributed to the nation's plan to reform libraries and schools and establish a national education system. During this time, she gained international recognition through her journalism, public speaking, and the publication of her work <i>Desolaci\u00f3n<\/i> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York<\/a>. She later published <i>Lecturas para Mujeres<\/i> (Readings for Women), a collection of prose and verse celebrating girls' education, featuring works by Latin American and European writers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>After spending nearly two years in Mexico, Mistral traveled to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Washington,_D.C.\" title=\"Washington, D.C.\">Washington D.C.<\/a>, where she addressed the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organization_of_American_States\" title=\"Organization of American States\">Pan American Union<\/a>, and then continued her journey to New York and Europe. In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Madrid\" title=\"Madrid\">Madrid<\/a>, she published <i>Ternura<\/i> (Tenderness), a collection of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lullaby\" title=\"Lullaby\">lullabies<\/a> and rondas intended for children, parents, and fellow poets. She returned to Chile in early 1925, formally retiring from the country's education system and receiving a pension. Just in time, as the legislature had recently granted the demands of the teachers' union, led by Mistral's rival <a href=\"\/wiki\/Amanda_Labarca\" title=\"Amanda Labarca\">Amanda Labarca Hubertson<\/a>, stipulating that only university-trained teachers could be appointed in schools. Despite her limited formal education, Mistral received the academic title of Spanish Professor from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Chile\" title=\"University of Chile\">University of Chile<\/a> in 1923, which highlighted her remarkable <a href=\"\/wiki\/Autodidacticism\" title=\"Autodidacticism\">self-education<\/a> and her intellectual abilities, nurtured by the vibrant culture of newspapers, magazines, and books in provincial Chile.\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/wiki\/Pablo_Neruda\" title=\"Pablo Neruda\">Pablo Neruda<\/a>, Chile's second Nobel Prize laureate in literature, met Mistral when she relocated to his hometown, Temuco.

In mid-1925, she was invited to represent Latin America in the newly formed Institute for Intellectual Cooperation of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/League_of_Nations\" title=\"League of Nations\">League of Nations<\/a>. In early 1926, she relocated to France, effectively becoming an exile for the rest of her life.

While serving as consul in Madrid, she had occasional professional interactions with fellow Chilean consul and Nobel Prize recipient Pablo Neruda. Mistral was among the early writers to recognize the importance and originality of Neruda's work, which she had known since he was a teenager and she was a school director in his hometown of Temuco.\n<\/p><p>Mistral published hundreds of articles in magazines and newspapers throughout the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hispanophone\" title=\"Hispanophone\">Spanish-speaking world<\/a>.

The grief from this loss, along with her responses to the tensions of <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cold_War\" title=\"Cold War\">Cold War<\/a> in Europe and the Americas, are reflected in her last volume of poetry published during her lifetime, <i>Lagar<\/i>, which appeared in a truncated form in 1954. Her partner <a href=\"\/wiki\/Doris_Dana\" title=\"Doris Dana\">Doris Dana<\/a> edited and published a final volume of poetry, <i>Poema de Chile<\/i>, posthumously in 1967. <i>Poema de Chile<\/i> depicts the poet's return to Chile after death, accompanied by an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\" title=\"Indigenous peoples of the Americas\">Indian<\/a> boy from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Atacama_Desert\" title=\"Atacama Desert\">Atacama desert<\/a> and an Andean deer, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hippocamelus\" title=\"Hippocamelus\">huemul<\/a>. This collection of poetry foreshadows the interest in objective description and re-vision of the epic tradition that would emerge among poets of the Americas, all of whom Mistral carefully read.<\/p><p>On 15 November 1945, Mistral became the first Latin American and the fifth woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gustaf_V\" title=\"Gustaf V\">King Gustav<\/a> of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sweden\" title=\"Sweden\">Sweden<\/a> presented her with the award in person on 10 December 1945.

In 1951, she was awarded the National Literature Prize in Chile.\n<\/p><p>Poor health limited Mistral's travel in her final years. She resided in the town of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Roslyn,_New_York\" title=\"Roslyn, New York\">Roslyn, New York<\/a>, and then transferred to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hempstead,_New_York\" title=\"Hempstead, New York\">Hempstead, New York<\/a>, where she died from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pancreatic_cancer\" title=\"Pancreatic cancer\">pancreatic cancer<\/a> on 10 January 1957 at the age of 67. Her remains were returned to Chile nine days later, and the Chilean government declared three days of <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_day_of_mourning\" title=\"National day of mourning\">national mourning<\/a>, with hundreds of thousands of mourners paying their respects.\n<\/p><p>Some of Mistral's best-known poems include <i>Piececitos de Ni\u00f1o<\/i>, <i>Balada<\/i>, <i>Todas \u00cdbamos a ser Reinas<\/i>, <i>La Oraci\u00f3n de la Maestra<\/i>, <i>El \u00c1ngel Guardi\u00e1n<\/i>, <i>Dec\u00e1logo del Artista<\/i>, and <i>La Flor del Aire<\/i>. She also wrote and published approximately 800 essays in magazines and newspapers. Mistral was renowned as a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Correspondent\" title=\"Correspondent\">correspondent<\/a> and highly regarded orator, both in person and through radio broadcasts.\n<\/p><p>Mistral may be most widely quoted in English for <i>Su Nombre es Hoy<\/i> (\"His Name is Today\"):\n<\/p><p>Mistral's work incorporates gray tones and conveys recurring feelings of sadness and bitterness, reflecting her difficult childhood marked by deprivation and a lack of affection at home. Despite this, her writings also reveal her deep affection for children, which she developed during her early years as a teacher in a rural school. Catholicism, a significant influence in Mistral's life, is also evident in her literature; however, she maintains a neutral stance toward religion. Her writing skillfully combines religious themes with emotions of love and piety, solidifying her position as one of the most esteemed representatives of Latin American literature in the 20th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_(1973%E2%80%9390)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)\">military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet<\/a> appropriated Gabriela Mistral's image, portraying her as a symbol of \"submission to authority\" and \"social order.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tiempo_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tiempo-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup> Author Licia Fiol-Matta challenged the traditional views of Mistral as a saint-like <a href=\"\/wiki\/Celibacy\" title=\"Celibacy\">celibate<\/a> and suffering heterosexual woman, suggesting that she was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">lesbian<\/a> instead. In 2007, after the death of Mistral's alleged last romantic partner, Doris Dana, her archive was discovered, containing letters exchanged between Mistral and various occasional female lovers. The publication of these letters in the book <i>Ni\u00f1a errante<\/i> (2007), edited by Pedro Pablo Zegers, supported the notion of a long-lasting romantic relationship between Mistral and Dana during Mistral's final years. The letters were later translated into English by Velma Garc\u00eda and published by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_New_Mexico_Press\" title=\"University of New Mexico Press\">University of New Mexico Press<\/a> in 2018.\nDespite these claims, Doris Dana, who was 31 years younger than Mistral, explicitly denied in her final interview that their relationship was ever romantic or erotic, describing it as that of a stepmother and stepdaughter. Dana also denied being a lesbian and expressed skepticism regarding Mistral's sexual orientation. \n<\/p><p>Mistral suffered from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Diabetes\" title=\"Diabetes\">diabetes<\/a> and heart problems, and she ultimately died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 67 on 10 January 1957,<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup> in Hempstead Hospital in New York City, with Doris Dana by her side.\n<\/p><p>On 7 April 2015, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Google\" title=\"Google\">Google<\/a> commemorated Gabriela Mistral's 126th birthday, honoring the Chilean poet and educator with a special <a href=\"\/wiki\/Google_Doodle\" title=\"Google Doodle\">doodle<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Gabriela Mistral has greatly influenced Latin American poetry.

Gullberg discussed how the language of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Troubadour\" title=\"Troubadour\">troubadours<\/a>, once unintelligible to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral's own mother, became the language of poetry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup> This language continued to thrive with the birth of Gabriela Mistral, whose voice shook the world and opened the eyes and ears of those willing to listen.\n<\/p><p>Gullberg noted that after experiencing the suicide of her first love, Gabriela Mistral emerged as a poet whose words spread across <a href=\"\/wiki\/South_America\" title=\"South America\">South America<\/a> and beyond. While little is known about her first love, his death influenced Mistral's poems, which often explored themes of death, despair, and possibly a resentment towards <a href=\"\/wiki\/God\" title=\"God\">God<\/a>. Her collection of poems titled <i>Desolaci\u00f3n<\/i>, inspired by the loss of her first love and later the death of a beloved nephew, impacted many others. The fifteenth poem in <i>Desolaci\u00f3n<\/i> expressed sorrow for the loss of a child and resonated with those who experienced the pain of losing loved ones.\n<\/p><p>However, Gabriela Mistral's books do not solely focus on themes of death, desolation, and loss. She also explored themes of love and motherhood, not only in relation to her beloved railroad employee and nephew but also in her interactions with the children she taught. Her collection of songs and rounds, titled <i>Ternura<\/i>, reflects her love for the children in her school. Published in Madrid in 1924, these heartfelt words were embraced by four thousand Mexican children who sang them as a tribute to Mistral. Her dedication to her children earned her the title of the Poet of Motherhood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Having lived through two world wars and other violent conflicts, Mistral's experiences paved the way for her third major collection, <i>Tala<\/i> (meaning \"ravage\" according to Gullberg). <i>Tala<\/i> encompasses a blend of sacred hymns, simple songs for children, and poems that touch on subjects like water, corn, salt, and wine. Gullberg pays homage to Mistral, acknowledging her as the great singer of sorrow and motherhood in Latin America. Mistral's collections of poems and songs beautifully express her care for children and the sorrows she endured as a teacher and poet in Latin America.
