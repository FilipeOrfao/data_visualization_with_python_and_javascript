Following the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand\" title=\"Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand\">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand<\/a> in June 1914, Andri\u0107 was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under <a href=\"\/wiki\/House_arrest\" title=\"House arrest\">house arrest<\/a>, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Zagreb\" title=\"Zagreb\">Zagreb<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Graz\" title=\"Graz\">Graz<\/a>, eventually attaining his PhD. in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia\" title=\"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\">Kingdom of Yugoslavia<\/a> from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nazi_Germany\" title=\"Nazi Germany\">Germany<\/a>, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Invasion_of_Yugoslavia\" title=\"Invasion of Yugoslavia\">German-led invasion of his country<\/a>. Shortly after the invasion, Andri\u0107 returned to German-occupied <a href=\"\/wiki\/Belgrade\" title=\"Belgrade\">Belgrade<\/a>. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Bridge_on_the_Drina\" title=\"The Bridge on the Drina\">Na Drini \u0107uprija<\/a><\/i> (<i>The Bridge on the Drina<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>Following the war, Andri\u0107 was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Committee\" title=\"Nobel Committee\">Nobel Committee<\/a> awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/J._R._R._Tolkien\" title=\"J.

M. Forster\">E. M. Forster<\/a>. The Committee cited \"the epic force with which he\u00a0... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\". Afterwards, Andri\u0107's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andri\u0107's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.\n<\/p><p>In the years following Andri\u0107's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former <a href=\"\/wiki\/Yugoslavia\" title=\"Yugoslavia\">Yugoslavia<\/a> also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker <a href=\"\/wiki\/Emir_Kusturica\" title=\"Emir Kusturica\">Emir Kusturica<\/a> began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is <a href=\"\/wiki\/Andri%C4%87grad\" title=\"Andri\u0107grad\">named after Andri\u0107<\/a>. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andri\u0107 was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia\" title=\"Breakup of Yugoslavia\">breakup of Yugoslavia<\/a>, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works had occasionally been blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution in the 1990s, but were rehabilitated by the literary community.

From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andri\u0107's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"The teaching program,\" biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, \"was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [Habsburg] Monarchy\".
