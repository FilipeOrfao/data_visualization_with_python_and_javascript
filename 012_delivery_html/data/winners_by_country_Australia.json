L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam struck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bragg%27s_law\" title=\"Bragg's law\">Bragg equation<\/a> that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\n<\/p><p>His father built an <a href=\"\/wiki\/X-ray_spectroscopy\" title=\"X-ray spectroscopy\">apparatus<\/a> in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Avogadro_constant\" title=\"Avogadro constant\">Avogadro constant<\/a>, which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", which he never overcame.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Bragg was commissioned early in <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I<\/a> in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Horse_Artillery\" title=\"Royal Horse Artillery\">Royal Horse Artillery<\/a> as a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_lieutenant\" title=\"Second lieutenant\">second lieutenant<\/a> of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leicestershire_Royal_Horse_Artillery\" title=\"Leicestershire Royal Horse Artillery\">Leicestershire battery<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup> In 1915 he was seconded to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Engineers\" title=\"Royal Engineers\">Royal Engineers<\/a> to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup> On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gallipoli_Campaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gallipoli Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup> Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Artillery_sound_ranging\" title=\"Artillery sound ranging\">sound ranging<\/a> was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone.

He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup> Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates.

The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: <a href=\"\/wiki\/Max_Perutz\" title=\"Max Perutz\">Max Perutz<\/a>. He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hemoglobin\" title=\"Hemoglobin\">haemoglobin<\/a>, which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Rockefeller_Foundation\" title=\"Rockefeller Foundation\">Rockefeller Foundation<\/a>. The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Enemy_alien\" title=\"Enemy alien\">enemy alien<\/a> and then worked in military research.\n<\/p><p>During the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for <a href=\"\/wiki\/Radar\" title=\"Radar\">radar<\/a>. Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, for which the Tucker microphone was still used. Bragg was knighted and became Sir Lawrence in 1941. After his father died in 1942, Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He also organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\n<\/p><p>After the war Bragg led in the formation of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/International_Union_of_Crystallography\" title=\"International Union of Crystallography\">International Union of Crystallography<\/a> and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]<\/a><\/sup> Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones, and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. Bragg's own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Electron_microscope\" title=\"Electron microscope\">electron microscope<\/a>. In 1947 he persuaded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Medical_Research_Council_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)\">Medical Research Council<\/a> (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">[27]<\/a><\/sup> to determine protein structure as the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laboratory of Molecular Biology\">Laboratory of Molecular Biology<\/a>, initially consisting of Perutz, <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Kendrew\" title=\"John Kendrew\">John Kendrew<\/a> and two assistants.

In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Institution_Christmas_Lectures\" title=\"Royal Institution Christmas Lectures\">Royal Institution Christmas Lecture<\/a> and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_Marriage_Guidance_Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"National Marriage Guidance Council\">National Marriage Guidance Council<\/a>, lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stephen_Bragg\" title=\"Stephen Bragg\">Stephen<\/a>, who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls-Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Brunel_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Brunel University\">Brunel University<\/a>.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup> He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution.

A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lysozyme\" title=\"Lysozyme\">lysozyme<\/a>; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by <a href=\"\/wiki\/David_Chilton_Phillips\" title=\"David Chilton Phillips\">D.

Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alpha_helix\" title=\"Alpha helix\">alpha-helix<\/a> conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/310_helix\" title=\"310 helix\">3<sub>10<\/sub> helix<\/a>, a conformation that they had proposed earlier.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup> In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms.

He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\n<\/p><p>X-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like.

During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\n<\/p><p>In 1934 White published a collection of poetry titled <i>The Ploughman and Other Poems<\/i>. The volume was published by <a href=\"\/wiki\/P._R._Stephensen\" title=\"P. R. Stephensen\">P. R.

In 1937 White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for <i>Happy Valley<\/i>. The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, <i>Nightside<\/i>, but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\n<\/p><p>In 1936, White met the painter <a href=\"\/wiki\/Roy_De_Maistre\" title=\"Roy De Maistre\">Roy De Maistre<\/a>, 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: both were gay and felt like outsiders in their own families, for whom both harboured ambivalent feelings yet maintained close lifelong links with them, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and its connections. Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common to both artists' work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[10]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>White dedicated his first novel <i>Happy Valley<\/i> to De Maistre, and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947 De Maistre's painting <i>Figure in a Garden (The Aunt)<\/i> was used as the cover for the first edition of White's <i>The Aunt's Story<\/i>. White bought many of De Maistre's paintings, all of which in 1974 he gave to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Art_Gallery_of_New_South_Wales\" title=\"Art Gallery of New South Wales\">Art Gallery of New South Wales<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Toward the end of the 1930s White spent time in the United States, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cape_Cod\" title=\"Cape Cod\">Cape Cod<\/a>, Massachusetts, and New York City \u2013 artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote <i>The Living and the Dead<\/i>.

White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but decided to persevere, and a breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Voss_(novel)\" title=\"Voss (novel)\">Voss<\/a><\/i>, won the inaugural <a href=\"\/wiki\/Miles_Franklin_Literary_Award\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Miles Franklin Literary Award\">Miles Franklin Literary Award<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1961, White published <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Riders_in_the_Chariot\" title=\"Riders in the Chariot\">Riders in the Chariot<\/a><\/i>, a bestseller and a prizewinner, garnering a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the Castle Hill house. A number of White's books from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla; his collection of short stories, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Burnt_Ones\" title=\"The Burnt Ones\">The Burnt Ones<\/a><\/i>, and the play, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Season_at_Sarsaparilla\" title=\"The Season at Sarsaparilla\">The Season at Sarsaparilla<\/a><\/i>. Clearly established in his reputation as one of the world's great authors, he remained a private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances, though his circle of friends widened significantly.\n<\/p><p>In 1968, White wrote <i>The Vivisector<\/i>, a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Passmore_(artist)\" title=\"John Passmore (artist)\">John Passmore<\/a> (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sidney_Nolan\" title=\"Sidney Nolan\">Sidney Nolan<\/a>, but White denied the connections.

To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neuron\" title=\"Neuron\">neurones<\/a>: a sensory neurone (the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Muscle_spindle\" title=\"Muscle spindle\">muscle spindle<\/a> fibre) and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Motor_neuron\" title=\"Motor neuron\">motor neurone<\/a>. The sensory neurone synapses onto the motor neurone in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spinal_cord\" title=\"Spinal cord\">spinal cord<\/a>. When a current is passed into the sensory neurone in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quadriceps\" title=\"Quadriceps\">quadriceps<\/a>, the motor neurone innervating the quadriceps produced a small <a href=\"\/wiki\/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential\" title=\"Excitatory postsynaptic potential\">excitatory postsynaptic potential<\/a> (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hamstring\" title=\"Hamstring\">hamstring<\/a>, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential\" title=\"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential\">inhibitory postsynaptic potential<\/a> (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neurone. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Action_potential\" title=\"Action potential\">action potential<\/a> in the motor neurone, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurones synapsing onto the motor neurone can cause the motor neurone to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neurone from firing.\n<\/p><p>Apart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neuroscience\" title=\"Neuroscience\">neuroscience<\/a>.

I have written at length on this philosophy in my book <i>Facing Reality<\/i>. In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karl_Popper\" title=\"Karl Popper\">Sir Karl Popper<\/a> with his concept of three worlds. I was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism\" title=\"Mind\u2013body dualism\">dualist<\/a>, now I am a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Trialism\" title=\"Trialism\">trialist<\/a>! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace <a href=\"\/wiki\/Monism\" title=\"Monism\">monism<\/a> to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are <a href=\"\/wiki\/Interactionism_(philosophy_of_mind)\" title=\"Interactionism (philosophy of mind)\">interactionists<\/a>, and what is more, <i>trialist interactionists<\/i>! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n<\/p><p><b>Fig. 6-1, Three Worlds<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n<\/p><p>\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\n<\/p><p>FIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n<\/p><p>\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n<\/p><p>\"In addition there is a level of <i>inner sense<\/i>, which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n<\/p><p>\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the <i>self<\/i> or <i>pure ego<\/i>, which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n<\/p><p>\"This World 2 is our <i>primary reality<\/i>. Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of <i>secondary reality<\/i>, a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n<\/p><p>\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n<\/p><p>\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Despite these words, in his late book <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/How_the_Self_Controls_Its_Brain\" title=\"How the Self Controls Its Brain\">How the Self Controls Its Brain<\/a><\/i>, Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\n<\/p><p>Eccles had nine children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nobelprize_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nobelprize-16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup> Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968.

Bowing to outside pressure for using science, in July 1916, the Admiralty appointed Bragg as scientific director at Aberdour, assisted by three additional young physicists.

Late in 1916, Bragg with his small group moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Harwich\" title=\"Harwich\">Harwich<\/a>, where the staff was enlarged and they had access to a submarine for tests.

The British made <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sonar\" title=\"Sonar\">sonar<\/a> practicable by using mosaics of small quartz bits rather than slices from a large crystal. In January 1918, Bragg moved into the Admiralty as head of scientific research in the anti-submarine division.
