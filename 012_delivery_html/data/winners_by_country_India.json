In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.\nSen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Social_choice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Social choice\">social choice<\/a>, which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kenneth_Arrow\" title=\"Kenneth Arrow\">Kenneth Arrow<\/a>.

This is because top-down development will always trump <a href=\"\/wiki\/Human_rights\" title=\"Human rights\">human rights<\/a> as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a \"right\" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have \"functionings\". These \"functionings\" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polling_station\" title=\"Polling station\">polls<\/a>. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the \"capabilities approach\" in practice, see <a href=\"\/wiki\/Martha_Nussbaum\" title=\"Martha Nussbaum\">Martha Nussbaum<\/a>'s <i>Women and Human Development<\/i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>He wrote a controversial article in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_New_York_Review_of_Books\" title=\"The New York Review of Books\">The New York Review of Books<\/a><\/i> entitled \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing\" (see <a href=\"\/wiki\/Missing_women_of_Asia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Missing women of Asia\">Missing women of Asia<\/a>), analysing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[34]<\/a><\/sup> Other studies, including one by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Emily_Oster\" title=\"Emily Oster\">Emily Oster<\/a>, had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">[35]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Development_as_Freedom\" title=\"Development as Freedom\">Development as Freedom<\/a><\/i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">[36]<\/a><\/sup> Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. \n<\/p><p>Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">[37]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In <i>Development as Freedom<\/i>, Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinise the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. \n<\/p><p>Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms. Sen notes that both countries had been working towards developing their economies-- China since 1979 and India since 1991.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">[38]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 2009, Sen published a book called <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Idea_of_Justice\" title=\"The Idea of Justice\">The Idea of Justice<\/a><\/i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Sen_2010_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Sen_2010-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Rawls\" title=\"John Rawls\">John Rawls<\/a> or <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Harsanyi\" title=\"John Harsanyi\">John Harsanyi<\/a>.
