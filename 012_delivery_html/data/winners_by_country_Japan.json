In his student days between 1938 and 1941, Fukui's interest was stimulated by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_mechanics\" title=\"Quantum mechanics\">quantum mechanics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger\" title=\"Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\">Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger<\/a>'s equation. He also had developed the belief that a breakthrough in science occurs through the unexpected fusion of remotely related fields.\n<\/p><p>In an interview with <i>The Chemical Intelligencer<\/i> Kenichi discusses his path towards chemistry starting from middle school.\n<\/p><p>On the advice of Kita, a personal friend of the elder Fukui, young Kenichi was directed to the Department of Industrial Chemistry, with which Kita was then affiliated. He also explains that chemistry was difficult to him because it seemed to require memorization to learn it, and that he preferred more logical character in chemistry. He followed the advice a mentor that was well respected by Kenichi himself and never looked back. He also followed in those footsteps by attending <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kyoto_University\" title=\"Kyoto University\">Kyoto University<\/a> in Japan.  During that same interview Kenichi also discussed his reason for preferring more theoretical chemistry rather than experimental chemistry. Although he certainly acceded at theoretical science he actually spent much of his early research on experimental. Kenichi had quickly completed more than 100 experimental projects and papers, and he rather enjoyed the experimental phenomena of chemistry. In fact, later on when teaching he would recommend experimental thesis projects for his students to balance them out, theoretical science came more natural to students, but by suggesting or assigning experimental projects his students could understand the concept of both, as all scientist should. Following his graduation from Kyoto Imperial University in 1941, Fukui was engaged in the Army Fuel Laboratory of Japan during <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a>.

Yonezawa and H. Shingu presented his molecular orbital theory of reactivity in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aromatic_hydrocarbons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Aromatic hydrocarbons\">aromatic hydrocarbons<\/a>, which appeared in the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Journal_of_Chemical_Physics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Journal of Chemical Physics\">Journal of Chemical Physics<\/a><\/i>. At that time, his concept failed to garner adequate attention among chemists. Fukui observed in his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_lecture\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobel lecture\">Nobel lecture<\/a> in 1981 that his original paper 'received a number of controversial comments. This was in a sense understandable, because for lack of my experiential ability, the theoretical foundation for this conspicuous result was obscure or rather improperly given.'\n<\/p><p>The frontier orbitals concept came to be recognized following the 1965 publication by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_B._Woodward\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert B. Woodward\">Robert B. Woodward<\/a> and Roald Hoffmann of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Woodward-Hoffmann_stereoselection_rules\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Woodward-Hoffmann stereoselection rules\">Woodward-Hoffmann stereoselection rules<\/a>, which could predict the reaction rates between two reactants. These rules, depicted in diagrams, explain why some pairs react easily while other pairs do not. The basis for these rules lies in the symmetry properties of the molecules and especially in the disposition of their electrons. Fukui had acknowledged in his Nobel lecture that, 'It is only after the remarkable appearance of the brilliant work by Woodward and Hoffmann that I have become fully aware that not only the density distribution but also the nodal property of the particular orbitals have significance in such a wide variety of chemical reactions.'\n<\/p><p>What has been striking in Fukui's significant contributions is that he developed his ideas before chemists had access to large computers for modeling. Apart from exploring the theory of chemical reactions, Fukui's contributions to chemistry also include the statistical theory of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gelation\" title=\"Gelation\">gelation<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organic_synthesis\" title=\"Organic synthesis\">organic synthesis<\/a> by inorganic salts and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polymerization\" title=\"Polymerization\">polymerization<\/a> kinetics.\n<\/p><p>In an interview to <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/New_Scientist\" title=\"New Scientist\">New Scientist<\/a><\/i> magazine in 1985, Fukui had been highly critical on the practices adopted in Japanese universities and industries to foster science. He noted, \"Japanese universities have a chair system that is a fixed hierarchy. This has its merits when trying to work as a laboratory on one theme. But if you want to do original work you must start young, and young people are limited by the chair system. Even if students cannot become assistant professors at an early age they should be encouraged to do original work.\" Fukui also admonished Japanese industrial research stating, \"Industry is more likely to put its research effort into its daily business. It is very difficult for it to become involved in pure chemistry. There is a need to encourage long-range research, even if we don't know its goal and if its application is unknown.\" In another interview with <i>The Chemical Intelligencer<\/i> he further elaborates on his criticism by saying, \"As is known worldwide, Japan has tried to catch up with the western countries since the beginning of this century by importing science from them.\" Japan is, in a sense, relatively new to fundamental science as a part of its society and the lack of originality ability, and funding which the western countries have more advantages in hurt the country in fundamental science. Although, he has also stated that it is improving in Japan, especially funding for fundamental science as it has seen a steady increase for years.\n<\/p><p>Fukui was awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Prize\">Nobel Prize<\/a> for his realization that a good approximation for reactivity could be found by looking at the frontier orbitals (<a href=\"\/wiki\/HOMO\/LUMO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HOMO\/LUMO\">HOMO\/LUMO<\/a>).

It was thought that cellular differentiation can only be a unidirectional process. Therefore, non-differentiated egg\/early embryo cells can only develop into specialized cells. However, stem cells with limited potency (adult stem cells) remain in bone marrow, intestine, skin etc. to act as a source of cell replacement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The fact that differentiated cell types had specific patterns of proteins suggested irreversible epigenetic modifications or genetic alterations to be the cause of unidirectional cell differentiation. So, cells progressively become more restricted in the differentiation potential and eventually lose pluripotency.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_13-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1962, <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Gurdon\" title=\"John Gurdon\">John B. Gurdon<\/a> demonstrated that the nucleus from a differentiated frog intestinal epithelial cell can generate a fully functional tadpole via transplantation to an enucleated egg. Gurdon used <a href=\"\/wiki\/Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer\" title=\"Somatic cell nuclear transfer\">somatic cell nuclear transfer<\/a> (SCNT) as a method to understand reprogramming and how cells change in specialization. He concluded that differentiated somatic cell nuclei had the potential to revert to pluripotency. This was a paradigm shift at the time. It showed that a differentiated cell nucleus has retained the capacity to successfully revert to an undifferentiated state, with the potential to restart development (pluripotent capacity).\n<\/p><p>However, the question still remained whether an intact differentiated cell could be fully reprogrammed to become pluripotent.\n<\/p><p>Shinya Yamanaka proved that introduction of a small set of transcription factors into a differentiated cell was sufficient to revert the cell to a pluripotent state. \nYamanaka focused on factors that are important for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. This was the first time an intact differentiated somatic cell could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent. \n<\/p><p>Knowing that transcription factors were involved in the maintenance of the pluripotent state, he selected a set of 24 ES cell transcriptional factors as candidates to reinstate pluripotency in somatic cells. First, he collected the 24 candidate factors. When all 24 genes encoding these transcription factors were introduced into skin fibroblasts, few actually generated colonies that were remarkably similar to ES cells.\nSecondly, further experiments were conducted with smaller numbers of transcription factors added to identify the key factors, through a very simple and yet sensitive assay system.\nLastly, he identified the four key genes. They found that 4 transcriptional factors (Myc, Oct3\/4, Sox2 and Klf4) were sufficient to convert mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells (capable of producing teratomas <i>in vivo<\/i> and contributing to chimeric mice).\n<\/p><p>These pluripotent cells are called iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells; they appeared with very low frequency. iPS cells can be selected by inserting the b-geo gene into the Fbx15 locus. The Fbx15 promoter is active in pluripotent stem cells which induce b-geo expression, which in turn gives rise to G418 resistance; this resistance helps us identify the iPS cells in culture.\n<\/p><p>Moreover, in 2007, Yamanaka and his colleagues found iPS cells with germline transmission (via selecting for Oct4 or Nanog gene). Also in 2007, they were the first to produce human iPS cells.\n<\/p><p>Some issues that current methods of induced pluripotency face are the very low production rate of iPS cells and the fact that the 4 transcriptional factors are shown to be oncogenic.\n<\/p><p>In July 2014, during a scandal involving Japanese stem cell researcher <a href=\"\/wiki\/Haruko_Obokata\" title=\"Haruko Obokata\">Haruko Obokata<\/a> fabricating data, doctoring images, and plagiarizing the work of others, Yamanaka faced public scrutiny for his associated work lacking full documentation.

They were engaged to be married in 1921, but only one month later Hatsuyo broke off the engagement for unclear reasons. Kawabata never completely recovered from the blow of losing her. Hatsuyo may have been the inspiration for some of his works, including the novella <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Dancing_Girl_of_Izu\" title=\"The Dancing Girl of Izu\">The Dancing Girl of Izu<\/a><\/i> and several <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Palm-of-the-Hand_Stories\" title=\"Palm-of-the-Hand Stories\">Palm-of-the-Hand Stories<\/a><\/i>.

During university, he changed faculties to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Japanese_literature\" title=\"Japanese literature\">Japanese literature<\/a> and wrote a graduation thesis titled \"A short history of Japanese novels\".

This journal was a reaction to the entrenched old school of Japanese literature, specifically the Japanese movement descended from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Naturalism_(literature)\" title=\"Naturalism (literature)\">Naturalism<\/a>, while it also stood in opposition to the \"workers'\" or <a href=\"\/wiki\/Proletarian_literature\" title=\"Proletarian literature\">proletarian literature<\/a> movement of the Socialist\/Communist schools.

The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs, but Kawabata's intent is rather to explore feelings about death. The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever, whereas people are frail and fleeting. These themes of implicit incest, impossible love and impending death are again explored in <i>The Sound of the Mountain<\/i>, set in Kawabata's adopted home of Kamakura.

It is a semi-fictional recounting of a major <a href=\"\/wiki\/Go_(board_game)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Go (board game)\">Go<\/a> match in 1938, on which he had actually reported for the <i>Mainichi<\/i> newspaper chain.

Although the novel is moving on the surface as a retelling of a climactic struggle, some readers consider it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II.\n<\/p><p>Through many of Kawabata's works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: \"I feel as though I have never held a woman's hand in a romantic sense [...] Am I a happy man deserving of pity?\u201d.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

This was done intentionally, as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were far more important than conclusions. He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Haiku\" title=\"Haiku\">haiku<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In addition to fictional writing, Kawabata also worked as a reporter, most notably for the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Mainichi_Shimbun\" title=\"Mainichi Shimbun\">Mainichi Shimbun<\/a><\/i>. Although he refused to participate in the militaristic fervor that accompanied <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a>, he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms. Along with the death of all his family members while he was young, Kawabata suggested that the war was one of the greatest influences on his work, stating he would be able to write only elegies in postwar Japan.
