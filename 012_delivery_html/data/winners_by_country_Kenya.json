These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karura_Forest\" title=\"Karura Forest\">Karura Forest<\/a>.

She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organisation. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Maendeleo_Ya_Wanawake\" title=\"Maendeleo Ya Wanawake\">Maendeleo Ya Wanawake<\/a>, a member organisation which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006156\u2013160_41-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006156%E2%80%93160-41\">[41]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1982, the Parliamentary seat representing her home region of Nyeri was open, and Maathai decided to campaign for the seat. As required by law, she resigned from her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality: as before, they claimed she should have re-registered to vote.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Palmer_2017_Vulnerability_and_Empowerment_42-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Palmer_2017_Vulnerability_and_Empowerment-42\">[42]<\/a><\/sup> When she requested her job back, she was denied.

In the course of her work through the NCWK, she had the opportunity to partner with the executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society, Wilhelm Elsrud. Maathai became the coordinator. Along with the partnership with the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received \"seed money\" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006168\u2013173_45-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006168%E2%80%93173-45\">[45]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The UN held the third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Helvi_Sipil%C3%A4\" title=\"Helvi Sipil\u00e4\">Helvi Sipil\u00e4<\/a>, the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairperson of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organisation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006175\u2013179_46-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006175%E2%80%93179-46\">[46]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006180\u2013183_47-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006180%E2%80%93183-47\">[47]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Uhuru_Park\" title=\"Uhuru Park\">Uhuru Park<\/a>.

The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the <i>Kenya Times<\/i>, the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/United_Nations_Educational,_Scientific_and_Cultural_Organization\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization<\/a> (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters.

On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organisations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organisation and its members \"a bunch of divorcees\".

In his first public comments peonhe project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had \"insects in their heads\". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006196_50-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaathai2006196-50\">[50]<\/a><\/sup> She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home.

Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail.
