Randall was negotiating with the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Medical_Research_Council_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)\">Medical Research Council<\/a> (MRC) to set up a laboratory to apply the experimental methods of physics to problems of biology. The combination of these disciplines as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Biophysics\" title=\"Biophysics\">biophysics<\/a> was a novel idea. The MRC told Randall that this had to be done in another university. In 1946 Randall was appointed Wheatstone Professor of Physics, in charge of the entire Physics department at King's College, London, with the funding to set up a Biophysics Unit. He brought Wilkins with him as Assistant Director of the unit. They appointed a team of scientists trained in both the physical and biological sciences. The \"management philosophy\" was to explore the use of many techniques in parallel, to find which looked promising, and then to focus on these. Wilkins, as the scientist with most diverse experience of physics and Assistant Director of the unit, had general oversight of the varied projects besides direct involvement in his personal research projects that included new types of optical microscopy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup> King's College received funding to build completely new Physics and Engineering Departments where vaults beneath the Strand level College forecourt had been destroyed by bombs during the War.

The laboratories were opened formally by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lord_Cherwell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lord Cherwell\">Lord Cherwell<\/a> on 27 June.

The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated.

It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked <a href=\"\/wiki\/James_D._Watson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"James D.

Franklin was delayed in finishing her work in Paris. Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins's preliminary work<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup> and that she should do X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer's samples of DNA.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RF-ProfilesInScience_31-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RF-ProfilesInScience-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins was away on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alex_Stokes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alex Stokes\">Alex Stokes<\/a>, who, like Crick, would solve the basic mathematics that make possible a general theory of how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin ended up with the DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.<sup id=\"cite_ref-RF-ProfilesInScience_31-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-RF-ProfilesInScience-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup> The confusion over Franklin's and Wilkins' roles in relation to the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort [on DNA] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]<\/a><\/sup> However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death. He later wrote \"My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [Gosling] and I got a clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work\u00a0... Trying to understand 'what really happened' when a very admirable scientist [Randall] models himself on Napoleon is not easy\u00a0... [but the letter] was very damaging to her and to me\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>By November 1951, Wilkins had evidence that DNA in cells as well as purified DNA had a helical structure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[34]<\/a><\/sup> Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH<sub>2<\/sub> groups of the bases could not be <a href=\"\/wiki\/Titration\" title=\"Titration\">titrated<\/a>, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hydrophile\" title=\"Hydrophile\">hydrophilic<\/a> part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

D. Bernal\">John Bernal<\/a>'s laboratory at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Birkbeck_College\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Birkbeck College\">Birkbeck College<\/a>, also in London.

Some of those working on DNA in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\">United Kingdom<\/a> feared that Pauling would quickly solve the DNA structure once he recognized his error and put the backbones of the nucleotide chains on the outside of a model of DNA. After March 1952 Franklin concentrated on the X-ray data for the A-form of less hydrated DNA while Wilkins tried to work on the hydrated B-form. Wilkins was handicapped because Franklin had all of the good DNA. Wilkins got new DNA samples, but it was not as good as the original sample he had obtained in 1950 and which Franklin continued to use. Most of his new results were for biological samples like sperm cells, which also suggested a helical structure for DNA. In July 1952 Franklin reported to him and Stokes that her newest results made her doubt the helical nature of the A-form.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
