He sought the support of the Contadora group for his plan, which involved the removal of all foreign powers from the region, an end to aid for antigovernment guerrillas in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and the implementation of democratic principles and a compromise peace for social reconstruction. Although his plan was not officially adopted, its key concepts were later reflected in the settlements in El Salvador (1990-1993) and Nicaragua (1989-1990).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>He was also a recipient of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Albert_Schweitzer_Prize_for_Humanitarianism\" title=\"Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism\">Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism<\/a> and a trustee of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Economists_for_Peace_and_Security\" title=\"Economists for Peace and Security\">Economists for Peace and Security<\/a>.

In 1986 he ran successfully for president on that party's ticket. Arias's presidency saw the transformation of Costa Rica's economy from one based on the traditional <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cash_crop\" title=\"Cash crop\">cash crops<\/a> (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Coffee\" title=\"Coffee\">coffee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Banana\" title=\"Banana\">bananas<\/a>) to one more focused on non-traditional agriculture (e.g., of exotic flowers and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fruit\" title=\"Fruit\">fruits<\/a>) and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tourism\" title=\"Tourism\">tourism<\/a>. Some within the PLN criticized his administration for abandoning the party's social democratic teachings and promoting a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neoliberal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neoliberal\">neoliberal<\/a> economic model.

This was a plan intended to promote <a href=\"\/wiki\/Democracy\" title=\"Democracy\">democracy<\/a> and peace on the Central American <a href=\"\/wiki\/Isthmus\" title=\"Isthmus\">isthmus<\/a> during a time of great turmoil: leftist guerrillas were fighting against the governments in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Salvadoran_Civil_War\" title=\"Salvadoran Civil War\">El Salvador<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Guatemalan_Civil_War\" title=\"Guatemalan Civil War\">Guatemala<\/a>, which were backed by the United States under the auspices of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cold_War\" title=\"Cold War\">Cold War<\/a>; the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Contras\" title=\"Contras\">Contras<\/a>, supported by the United States, were fighting an insurgency against the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sandinista\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sandinista\">Sandinista<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nicaragua\" title=\"Nicaragua\">Nicaragua<\/a>; <a href=\"\/wiki\/Honduras\" title=\"Honduras\">Honduras<\/a>, only recently wresting political power from its military, was caught in the middle as a base for U.S. military forces; and on Costa Rica's other border, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Panama\" title=\"Panama\">Panama<\/a> faced the oppression of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Manuel_Noriega\" title=\"Manuel Noriega\">Manuel Noriega<\/a>'s military dictatorship. With the support of Arias, the various armed conflicts ended within the decade (Guatemala's civil war finally ended in 1996).\n<\/p><p>Arias then called for a higher level of integration in the Central America region and promoted the creation of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Central_American_Parliament\" title=\"Central American Parliament\">Central American Parliament<\/a> (<i>Parlamento Centroamericano<\/i>). During his current administration, Arias has declared that Costa Rica will not enter the Central American Parliament.  Arias also modified the country's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Education_in_Costa_Rica\" title=\"Education in Costa Rica\">educational system<\/a>. The most notable action in this respect was the reintroduction of standardized academic tests at the end of primary and secondary school.\n<\/p><p>The Costa Rican constitution had been amended in 1969 to include a clause forbidding former presidents to seek re-election. Arias challenged this at the Sala IV, the Constitutional Chamber of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Supreme_Court_of_Justice_of_Costa_Rica\" title=\"Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica\">Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica<\/a>, which initially rejected his application in September 2000. In 2003, a group of Arias supporters presented an unconstitutionality challenge against the 1969 constitutional amendment forbidding re-election, and this time the ruling in April 2003 struck down the prohibition against non-consecutive re-election.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> This decision was denounced as a \"state blow\" or \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" by ex-president <a href=\"\/wiki\/Luis_Alberto_Monge\" title=\"Luis Alberto Monge\">Luis Alberto Monge<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Arias announced in 2004 that he intended to run again for president in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/2006_Costa_Rican_presidential_election\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2006 Costa Rican presidential election\">February 2006 general elections<\/a>.  By then, he was the only living former president who was not either in jail, under indictment or facing an investigation.  Though for years private polling companies and several news media published polls predicting Arias would win by a wide margin, the election was initially deemed too close to call. A month later, on 7 March, after a manual recount, the official results showed Arias beat center-left contender <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ott%C3%B3n_Sol%C3%ADs\" title=\"Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds\">Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds<\/a> by 18,169 votes (1.2% of valid votes cast), and finished just a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to capture the presidency in a single round. He took the oath of office at noon on 8 May 2006 at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Estadio_Nacional_de_Costa_Rica_(1924)\" title=\"Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica (1924)\">National Stadium<\/a>.

Directed at fellow Latin American leaders, he decried Latin America's lack of development compared to other parts of the world, calling for pragmatism, and more resources directed at education rather than militaries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 2009, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Supreme_Court_of_Honduras\" title=\"Supreme Court of Honduras\">Supreme Court of Honduras<\/a> issued an arrest warrant for Honduran President <a href=\"\/wiki\/Manuel_Zelaya\" title=\"Manuel Zelaya\">Manuel Zelaya<\/a> because of violations of the constitution and laws.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-art239_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-art239-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup> Two days later, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_Congress_of_Honduras\" title=\"National Congress of Honduras\">National Congress of Honduras<\/a> (in which Zelaya's own party held 62 out of 128 seats, more than any other party), also voted to dismiss Zelaya.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup>\nZelaya fled to Costa Rica.

Representatives of the two Hondurans met with Arias on various occasions but so far have failed to reach any kind of agreement.  As described above (with factual citations), Arias himself was initially prohibited by Costa Rica's constitutional court from another term, due to constitutional <a href=\"\/wiki\/Term_limit\" title=\"Term limit\">term limits<\/a>, but this was reversed using legal means, with the consent of the Costa Rican Sala IV court, unlike in Honduras. New elections in Honduras are planned for 29 November 2009. Micheletti's government stated on 2 July 2009 that it is willing to hold this year's presidential election early. Arias presented a seven-point agreement, which calls for the return of Zelaya as president \u2013 a condition deemed unacceptable to the interim government. Zelaya's representatives accepted the Arias proposal \"in principle\" but Micheletti's representatives balked at the key point of Zelaya returning to power in Honduras.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In August 2007, Arias was affected by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tendinitis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tendinitis\">tendinitis<\/a>, and in April 2008 he canceled some activities because of muscular pain in his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lumbar_region\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lumbar region\">lumbar region<\/a>.

The route from Escaz\u00fa to Caldera built by the Spanish company Autopistas del Sol has undergone heavy criticism over the years for its high tolls and dangerous roads (which had to undergo heavy maintenance to prevent further rock slides). Oscar Arias was also blamed for having invited a Canadian corporation to perform heavy mining which could potentially compromise the local biodiversity. Their permissions were revoked during the Chinchilla Miranda administration which gave the impression of Arias-Chinchilla enmity following his sudden criticism of then president Laura Chinchilla Miranda who was popularly regarded as a successor.\n<\/p><p>In 2017 Costa Rica's General Attorney office indicted Arias for the Crucitas case, a case in which former Environment Minister Roberto Dobles and Arias as president signed a 2008 decree ceding the Canadian company Infinito Gold control over a protected area near the Nicaraguan border known as Crucitas for gold mining and declaring it \"national interest\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-robles_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-robles-23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup> something that the Prosecution argued was illegal as protected areas cannot be granted for exploitation of any kind.
