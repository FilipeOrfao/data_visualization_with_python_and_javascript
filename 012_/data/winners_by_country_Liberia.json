After her Nobel Prize winning in 2011, she did multiple interviews, specifying the importance of her inclusion and determination in using religion as the stepping stone for achieving peace in Liberia. On October 6, 2016, Gbowee did an interview with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Harvard_Divinity_School\" title=\"Harvard Divinity School\">Harvard Divinity Schools<\/a>, speaking on her topic \"Women as Catalysts for Local and Global Spiritually-Engaged Movements for Sustainable Peace.\"\n<\/p><p>Gbowee used religion and spirituality as strategies to rally women for ending Liberia\u2019s two civil wars . Tactics that she used such as religious and traditional songs to help create a bonding community with her women. Throughout her memoir, <i>Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War; a Memoir,<\/i> One can perceive the influence of her religious beliefs on initiatives for restoring peace in Liberia. After the second civil war broke out in 1999, increasing the already existing problem of rape and systematic brutality in Liberia, Gbowee felt the need for an inter-religious call for action.<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">[40]<\/a><\/sup> In response to this second wave of deadly conflict, Gbowee formed an inter-religious peace building coalition of Christian and Muslim women, which lead to the uproar of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Women_of_Liberia_Mass_Action_for_Peace\" title=\"Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace\">Liberia Mass Action for Peace Movement<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_41-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-41\">[41]<\/a><\/sup> With her involvement in these powerful settings, Gbowee gained a great amount of leadership skills in which she combined with her religious background. During the LMAPM, she along with other women activists, formed multiple pray-ins, using it as a form of nonviolent protest.

Although her memoir depicts instances of loss, pain, grief, and disappointment that made her question her faith, she indicates that prayer has been an intrinsic part of her journey in\u00a0 peace building. She writes, \u201cGod is ever faithful, ever loving; he listens to our prayers.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-MightyBe_6-69\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MightyBe-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> She used prayer as a source of protection,\u00a0 hope, and guidance in her activist work. Gbowee perceive Christianity to be very self-serving and crucial to the social and cultural realities of the Liberian people . Gbowee believes that for adequate results to be seen in conflict situations, especially the ones in which she was involved in, prayer had to occupy center stage. This is a central characteristic of her identity as a global activist as it is an important part of her work. Being involved in groups such as the Christian Women\u2019s Peace Initiative (CWI), helped her to embody this part of her faith into bringing peace and teaching peace to others over the past year.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_41-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-41\">[41]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Religion influenced Gbowee's approach to peace building as a type of mothering. In fact, she engages the often marginalized voices of women and young men who bear the brunt of war. Gbowee has used religion to achieve many of her activist roles throughout her traveling career and teaching in healing spaces. An important role that she and other powerful women such as Ekiyor, used religion as a support tool to mother those who have been traumatized, searching for peace within their communities, their homes, and their country.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MightyBe_6-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MightyBe-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> Praying had always been a part of Gbowee\u2019s life, especially in her romantic life. Using prayer for her was a healing tool that helped her overcome her abusive relationships and protect her children. One aspect of Gbowee using religion and faith as a form of mothering is by using it as a resource to help whoever she is helping feel connected. She used her faith and beliefs, especially the bible to help them understand their shared experiences and trauma.\u00a0 In September 2016, Gbowee did an interview at the Harvard Divinity School on \u201cReligion and The Practice of Peace.\u201d She points out that Religion and spirituality were common aspects in the lives of the women who participated in the Liberian Women\u2019s Mass Action for Peace. These spiritual encounters are what she used in her community to mobilize and empower women to take action in all aspects of their lives, whether personal, spiritual, or political.\u00a0 In the Harvard interview, she states:\n<\/p><p>\u201cIn our group the first thing we did was to hold three days of consultative meetings. The first day we brought only Christian women, and we went back into the Bible to find those things in the Bible that women did. We wanted to really show them (Christian women) that God had a way of using women and that there\u2019s a place for women in turning around the history of their nations. So, we took them to the Bible, and we used women of faith as examples\u2014Esther, Deborah, Rahab the Prostitute\u2014who had done great things to turn the tide. We used those women as the springboard for really mobilizing women.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_43-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-43\">[43]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Religion and the bible enabled Gbowee to convey her vision to Liberian women with different creeds. In order to build stronger communities for peace-building and promoting activism included the containment of other religious groups, which is a big part of the Women\u2019s movement\u2019s success. However, for Gbowee, building a stronger community amongst women that will put them at the forefront of such a major movement for the end of wars and not limiting her beliefs to just Christianity, is a tactic she encouraged. In the Harvard interview again, she states that:\n\u201cThe second thing we did was to bring the Muslim women together and go through the same process, but with the Qur\u2019an...We would talk and read some of the descriptions that talk about how to treat women better and live a nonviolent life\u2026\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_43-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-43\">[43]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Using faith as a common denominator amongst all women, helped them to create a closer leadership bond. Gbowee came from a mixed religious and spiritual community where her parents were Christians, but their close friends and neighbors were Muslims. Using religion to bring young people together, especially for young girls and women, became a motive and a goal for Gbowee to help breed leadership and women empowerment skills through her activism, creating new leaders for the future.\n<\/p><p>Gbowee had worked in multiple healing spaces, for example, the Trauma Healing Office, where she traveled around Liberia to different communities, trying to educate people on how to deal with their traumas. She felt as if this is her calling from God.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MightyBe_6-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MightyBe-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> Because of the severity of the war and her trying to provide for her family, keeping a strong faith is used to help provide comfort through her work, especially since her target is towards weakened women and young boys who have been a part of the destructive process against their wills. Through her activism work in her communities in Liberia, it is fueled by her experiences at home. She is not able to mother her children the way she wanted, and to her, apart from her children, not losing faith is most important for her. People whom she had helped in both Liberia and Ghana referred to her as being \u201cBig Mama\u201d or \u201cMother of Peace.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-MightyBe_6-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MightyBe-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Religion and spirituality for Gbowee are considered essential in the peace coalition and the healing of everyone and everywhere. She believes that to overcome injustices that take over people's livelihood and the way they live their day to day lives, it calls for true believers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_44-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup> Being a religious person in these settings, for Gbowee, revenge is not the way to go. She recounts reading the bible and searching for different accounts that encourage peace and not an \u201ceye for an eye.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_44-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup> For Gbowee, religion and its relevance helps to teach compassion and practice forgiveness which had also contributed to the success of her activism work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_44-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">[45]<\/a><\/sup> Working with angered people who had dealt with social and political trauma, forgiveness became a part of the healing process and education for her intended audiences. To Gbowee, forgiveness does not have a specific religious practice attached to it, but multiple. She mentions at a peace conference that, \u201cIn my life\u2019s journey, it hasn\u2019t been just Christians who have reached out to me. It hasn\u2019t been just Muslims. It has been people of different faiths.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-:2_44-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:2-44\">[44]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In terms of her contributions to the conceptions of violence, Gbowee also used her faith to emphasize the importance of non-violence approaches. This is especially prominent in the Women\u2019s movement and her involvement while working with the Women in Peace-building Network (WIPNET).<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">[46]<\/a><\/sup> She used women who are also strong in faith and who have struggles with close contact with acts of violence although all were in a larger sense. Many of the women that were active with Gbowee, faced violence such as sexual, physical, emotional, mental, and physical forces. Traditional religious songs and dances were used in the non-violent, healing, and peace. These dances and songs are used as a form of storytelling.\n<\/p><p>Gbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith. She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: \"All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-MightyBe_6-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MightyBe-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup><sup class=\"reference nowrap\"><span title=\"Page \/ location: 245\">:\u200a245\u200a<\/span><\/sup> She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009:\n<\/p><p>Gbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to \"crippling hopelessness\", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-podcastFaith_30-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-podcastFaith-30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>As suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women's movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers:\n<\/p><p>In an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a \"Higher Power.\" She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can \"rise up and do something to change your situation.\" She advised: \"Don't wait for a Gandhi, don't wait for a King, don't wait for a Mandela. <i>You<\/i> are your own Mandela, <i>you<\/i> are your own Gandhi, <i>you<\/i> are your own King.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">[47]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Gbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Documentary_film\" title=\"Documentary film\">documentary film<\/a> <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Pray_the_Devil_Back_to_Hell\" title=\"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\">Pray the Devil Back to Hell<\/a><\/i>, which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period.
