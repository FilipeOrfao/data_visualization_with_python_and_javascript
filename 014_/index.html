      <h2>A few exploratory nuggets</h2>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Some nuggets of data mined from a dataset of Nobel prize winners
          (2023).
        </p>
      </div>

            These two charts compare Nobel prize winners by country. The
            absolute numbers are compared to the per-capita measure which takes
            into account the population size of the respective countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low winning outliers with less than two prizes are removed from the
            relative set.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the absolute prize tally shows the expected dominance of the
            United States and historically influential countries, by adjusting
            for population size we see a very different, arguably fairer
            selection of achievements. Scandinavian countries do very well, as
            does Switzerland, a favorite of Nobel prize winning emigres. One
            caveat is that Sweden, winner by a relative metric, hosts the
            prize.
