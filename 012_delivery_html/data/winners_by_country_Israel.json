He remained in opposition in the eight consecutive elections (except for a national unity government around the <a href=\"/wiki/Six-Day_War\" title=\"Six-Day War\">Six-Day War</a>), but became more acceptable to the political center.

Later, Begin's government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Opera\" title=\"Operation Opera\">bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant</a> in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight <a href=\"/wiki/PLO\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PLO\">PLO</a> strongholds there, igniting the <a href=\"/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War\" title=\"1982 Lebanon War\">1982 Lebanon War</a>.

Depressed by the death of his wife <a href=\"/wiki/Aliza_Begin\" title=\"Aliza Begin\">Aliza</a> in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.\n</p><p>Menachem Begin was born to Zeev Dov and Hassia Begun in what was then Brest-Litovsk in the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Empire\" title=\"Russian Empire\">Russian Empire</a> (today <a href=\"/wiki/Brest,_Belarus\" title=\"Brest, Belarus\">Brest</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Belarus\" title=\"Belarus\">Belarus</a>). He was the youngest of three children.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> On his mother's side he was descended from distinguished rabbis.

In his childhood, Begin, like most Jewish children in his town, was a member of the Zionist scouts movement <a href=\"/wiki/Hashomer_Hatzair\" title=\"Hashomer Hatzair\">Hashomer Hatzair</a>. He was a member of Hashomer Hatzair until the age of 13, and at 16, he joined <a href=\"/wiki/Betar_(youth_movement)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Betar (youth movement)\">Betar</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> At 14, he was sent to a Polish government school,<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> where he received a solid grounding in <a href=\"/wiki/Classical_literature\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Classical literature\">classical literature</a>.\n</p><p>Begin studied law at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Warsaw\" title=\"University of Warsaw\">University of Warsaw</a>, where he learned the <a href=\"/wiki/Eloquence\" title=\"Eloquence\">oratory</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Rhetoric\" title=\"Rhetoric\">rhetoric</a> skills that became his trademark as a politician, and viewed as <a href=\"/wiki/Demagogy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Demagogy\">demagogy</a> by his critics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>During his studies, he organized a self-defense group of Jewish students to counter harassment by anti-Semites on campus.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> He graduated in 1935, but never practiced law.

As head of Betar's Polish branch, Begin traveled among regional branches to encourage supporters and recruit new members. To save money, he stayed at the homes of Betar members. During one such visit, he met his future wife <a href=\"/wiki/Aliza_Begin\" title=\"Aliza Begin\">Aliza Arnold</a>, who was the daughter of his host. The couple married on 29 May 1939. They had three children: <a href=\"/wiki/Benny_Begin\" title=\"Benny Begin\">Binyamin</a>, Leah and Hassia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Living in Warsaw in Poland, Begin encouraged Betar to set up an organization to bring Polish Jews to Palestine. He unsuccessfully attempted to smuggle 1,500 Jews into <a href=\"/wiki/Romania\" title=\"Romania\">Romania</a> at the end of August 1939. Returning to Warsaw afterward, he left three days after the German <a href=\"/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland\" title=\"Invasion of Poland\">1939 invasion</a> began, first to the southwest and then to <a href=\"/wiki/Wilno\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wilno\">Wilno</a>.\n</p><p>In September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, Begin, in common with a large part of Warsaw's Jewish leadership, escaped to Wilno (today <a href=\"/wiki/Vilnius\" title=\"Vilnius\">Vilnius</a>), then eastern Poland, to avoid inevitable arrest. The town was soon occupied by the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a>, but from 28 October 1939, it was the capital of the Republic of Lithuania. Wilno was a predominately Polish and <a href=\"/wiki/Polish_Jews\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polish Jews\">Jewish</a> town; an estimated 40 percent of the population was Jewish, with the <a href=\"/wiki/YIVO\" title=\"YIVO\">YIVO</a> institute located there. As a prominent pre-war Zionist and reserve status officer-cadet, on 20 September 1940, Begin was arrested by the <a href=\"/wiki/NKVD\" title=\"NKVD\">NKVD</a> and detained in the <a href=\"/wiki/Luki%C5%A1k%C4%97s_Prison\" title=\"Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison\">Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison</a>. In later years he wrote about his experience of being tortured. He was accused of being an \"agent of British <a href=\"/wiki/Imperialism\" title=\"Imperialism\">imperialism</a>\" and sentenced to eight years in the Soviet <a href=\"/wiki/Gulag\" title=\"Gulag\">gulag</a> camps. On 1 June 1941 he was sent to the <a href=\"/wiki/Pechora\" title=\"Pechora\">Pechora</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Labor_camp\" title=\"Labor camp\">labor camps</a> in Komi Republic, the northern part of European Russia, where he stayed until May 1942. Much later in life, Begin recorded and reflected upon his experiences in the interrogations and life in the camp in his memoir <i><a href=\"/wiki/White_Nights_(book)\" title=\"White Nights (book)\">White Nights</a></i>.\n</p><p>In July 1941, just after <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa\" title=\"Operation Barbarossa\">Germany attacked the Soviet Union</a>, and following his release under the <a href=\"/wiki/Sikorski%E2%80%93Mayski_agreement\" title=\"Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement\">Sikorski\u2013Mayski agreement</a> because he was a Polish national, Begin joined the Free Polish <a href=\"/wiki/Anders%27_Army\" title=\"Anders' Army\">Anders' Army</a> as a <a href=\"/wiki/Corporal\" title=\"Corporal\">corporal</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Officer_cadet\" title=\"Officer cadet\">officer cadet</a>. He was later sent with the army to <a href=\"/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine\" title=\"Mandatory Palestine\">Palestine</a> via the <a href=\"/wiki/Persian_Corridor\" title=\"Persian Corridor\">Persian Corridor</a>, where he arrived in May 1942.<sup id=\"cite_ref-haber1978_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-haber1978-17\">[17]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Upon arriving in Palestine, Begin, like many other Polish Jewish soldiers of the Anders' Army, faced a choice between remaining with the Anders' Army to fight Nazi Germany in Europe, or staying in Palestine to fight for establishment of a Jewish state. While he initially wished to remain with the Polish army, he was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his contacts in the Irgun, as well as Polish officers sympathetic to the Zionist cause. Consequently, General <a href=\"/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski\">Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski</a>, the second-in-command of the Army, issued Begin with a \"leave of absence without an expiration\" which gave Begin official permission to stay in Palestine. In December 1942 he left Anders's Army and joined the Irgun.<sup id=\"cite_ref-LeavingAndersArmy_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LeavingAndersArmy-18\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p><p>During <a href=\"/wiki/The_Holocaust\" title=\"The Holocaust\">the Holocaust</a>, Begin's father was among the 5,000 Brest Jews rounded up by the Nazis at the end of June 1941. Instead of being sent to a forced labor camp, they were shot or drowned in the river. His mother and his elder brother Herzl also were murdered in the Holocaust.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Begin quickly made a name for himself as a fierce critic of the dominant <a href=\"/wiki/Mapai\" title=\"Mapai\">Zionist leadership</a> for being too cooperative with the British, and argued that the only way to save the Jews of Europe, who were facing extermination, was to compel the British to leave so that a Jewish state could be established. In 1942 he joined the <a href=\"/wiki/Irgun\" title=\"Irgun\">Irgun</a> (<i>Etzel</i>), an underground Zionist paramilitary organization which had split from the main Jewish military organization, the <a href=\"/wiki/Haganah\" title=\"Haganah\">Haganah</a>, in 1931. Begin assumed the Irgun's leadership in 1944, determined to force the British government to remove its troops entirely from Palestine. The official Jewish leadership institutions in Palestine, the <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel\" title=\"Jewish Agency for Israel\">Jewish Agency</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_National_Council\" title=\"Jewish National Council\">Jewish National Council</a> (\"Vaad Leumi\"), backed up by their military arm, the <a href=\"/wiki/Haganah\" title=\"Haganah\">Haganah</a>, had refrained from directly challenging British authority. They were convinced that the British would establish a Jewish state after the war due to support for the Zionist cause among both the Conservative and Labour parties. Giving as reasons that the British had reneged on the promises given in the <a href=\"/wiki/Balfour_Declaration\" title=\"Balfour Declaration\">Balfour Declaration</a> and that the <a href=\"/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939\" title=\"White Paper of 1939\">White Paper of 1939</a> restricting Jewish immigration was an escalation of their pro-Arab policy, he decided to break with the official institutions and launch an armed rebellion against British rule, in cooperation with <a href=\"/wiki/Lehi_(group)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lehi (group)\">Lehi</a>, another breakaway Zionist group.\n</p><p>Begin had also carefully studied the tactics of the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_independence_movement\" title=\"Indian independence movement\">Indian independence movement</a>. Even more importantly, during multiple meetings with <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_Jew\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Irish Jew\">Jewish</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_Dublin\" title=\"Lord Mayor of Dublin\">Lord Mayor of Dublin</a> and senior IRA veteran <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Briscoe_(politician)\" title=\"Robert Briscoe (politician)\">Robert Briscoe</a>, who jokingly described himself as the \"Chair of Subversive Activity against England\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup> Begin had also carefully studied the highly successful use of <a href=\"/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare\" title=\"Guerrilla warfare\">guerrilla warfare</a> tactics by <a href=\"/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)\" title=\"Michael Collins (Irish leader)\">Michael Collins</a> during the <a href=\"/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence\" title=\"Irish War of Independence\">Irish War of Independence</a>. While planning the rebellion with Irgun commanders, Begin accordingly devised a highly similar strategy that he believed would force the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Empire\" title=\"British Empire\">British Empire</a> out. He proposed a series of <a href=\"/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare\" title=\"Guerrilla warfare\">guerrilla warfare</a> attacks that would humiliate the <a href=\"/wiki/British_Empire\" title=\"British Empire\">British Empire</a> and damage their prestige; this would cause the British Cabinet, as they had with the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_and_Tans\" title=\"Black and Tans\">Black and Tans</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Auxiliary_Division\" title=\"Auxiliary Division\">Auxiliary Division</a> in Ireland, to unleash indiscriminate <a href=\"/wiki/Total_war\" title=\"Total war\">total war</a> tactics against the whole Jewish civilian population, which would completely alienate the <a href=\"/wiki/Yishuv\" title=\"Yishuv\">Yishuv</a>. Similarly to Michael Collins, Begin banked on the international media being attracted to the action, which he referred to as turning Palestine into a \"glass house\", as the whole world looked inside. He knew that British total war and civilian repression would create both global sympathy for the Irgun's cause and international diplomatic pressure on Britain. Ultimately, the British Cabinet would be forced to choose between further escalating the repression or complete withdrawal, and Begin was certain that in the end, the British would leave. Further, so as not to disturb the Allied war effort against <a href=\"/wiki/Nazi_Germany\" title=\"Nazi Germany\">Nazi Germany</a>, only British civilian administration and <a href=\"/wiki/Palestine_Police_Force\" title=\"Palestine Police Force\">Palestine Police Force</a> targets would be attacked at first, while <a href=\"/wiki/British_armed_forces\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British armed forces\">British armed forces</a> personnel would only be attacked after <a href=\"/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\" title=\"Adolf Hitler\">Adolf Hitler</a> had been defeated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bell_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bell-21\">[21]</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 1 February 1944, the Irgun proclaimed a revolt. Twelve days later, it put its plan into action when Irgun teams bombed the empty offices of the British Mandate's Immigration Department in <a href=\"/wiki/Jerusalem\" title=\"Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tel_Aviv\" title=\"Tel Aviv\">Tel Aviv</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Haifa\" title=\"Haifa\">Haifa</a>. The Irgun next bombed the Income Tax Offices in those three cities, followed by a series of attacks on police stations in which two Irgun fighters and six policemen were killed. Meanwhile, Lehi joined the revolt with a series of shooting attacks on policemen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bell_21-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bell-21\">[21]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Irgun and Lehi attacks intensified throughout 1944. These operations were financed by demanding money from Jewish merchants and engaging in insurance scams in the local diamond industry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1944, after Lehi gunmen assassinated <a href=\"/wiki/Walter_Guinness,_1st_Baron_Moyne\" title=\"Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne\">Lord Moyne</a>, the British Resident Minister in the Middle East, the official Jewish authorities, fearing British retaliation, ordered the Haganah to undertake a campaign of collaboration with the British. Known as <a href=\"/wiki/The_Hunting_Season\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"The Hunting Season\">The Hunting Season</a>, the campaign seriously crippled the Irgun for several months, while Lehi, having agreed to suspend their anti-British attacks, was spared. Begin, anxious to prevent a civil war, ordered his men not to retaliate or resist being taken captive, convinced that the Irgun could ride out the Season, and that the Jewish Agency would eventually side with the Irgun when it became apparent the British government had no intention of making concessions. Gradually, shamed at participating in what was viewed as a collaborationist campaign, the enthusiasm of the Haganah began to wane, and Begin's assumptions were proven correct. The Irgun's restraint also earned it much sympathy from the Yishuv, whereas previously it had been assumed by many that it had placed its own political interests before those of the Yishuv.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bell_21-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bell-21\">[21]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the summer of 1945, as it became clear that the British were not planning on establishing a Jewish state and would not allow significant Jewish immigration to Palestine, Jewish public opinion shifted decisively against the British, and the Jewish authorities sent feelers to the Irgun and Lehi to discuss an alliance. The result was the <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_Resistance_Movement\" title=\"Jewish Resistance Movement\">Jewish Resistance Movement</a>, a framework under which the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi launched coordinated series of anti-British operations. For several months in 1945\u201346, the Irgun fought as part of the Jewish Resistance Movement. Following <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Agatha\" title=\"Operation Agatha\">Operation Agatha</a>, during which the British arrested many Jews, seized arms caches, and occupied the Jewish Agency building, from which many documents were removed, Begin ordered an attack on the British military and administrative headquarters at the <a href=\"/wiki/King_David_Hotel\" title=\"King David Hotel\">King David Hotel</a> following a request from the Haganah, although the Haganah's permission was later rescinded. The <a href=\"/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing\" title=\"King David Hotel bombing\">King David Hotel bombing</a> resulted in the destruction of the building's southern wing, and 91 people, mostly British, Arabs, and Jews, were killed.\n</p><p>The fragile partnership collapsed following the bombing, partly because contrary to instructions, it was carried out during the busiest part of the day at the hotel. The Haganah, from then on, would rarely mount attacks against British forces and would focus mainly on the <a href=\"/wiki/Aliyah_Bet\" title=\"Aliyah Bet\">Aliyah Bet</a> illegal immigration campaign, and while it occasionally took half-hearted measures against the Irgun, it never returned to full-scale collaboration with the British. The Irgun and Lehi continued waging a full-scale insurgency against the British, and together with the Haganah's illegal immigration campaign, this forced a large commitment of British forces to Palestine that was gradually sapping British financial resources. Three particular Irgun operations directly ordered by Begin: the <a href=\"/wiki/Night_of_the_Beatings\" title=\"Night of the Beatings\">Night of the Beatings</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Acre_Prison_break\" title=\"Acre Prison break\">Acre Prison break</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/The_Sergeants_affair\" title=\"The Sergeants affair\">Sergeants affair</a>, were cited as particularly influencing the British to leave due to the great loss of British prestige and growing public opposition to Britain remaining in Palestine at home they generated. In September 1947, the British cabinet voted to leave Palestine, and in November of that year, the United Nations approved a resolution to partition the country between Arabs and Jews. The financial burden imposed on Britain by the Jewish insurgency, together with the tremendous public opposition to keeping troops in Palestine it generated among the British public was later cited by British officials as a major factor in Britain's decision to evacuate Palestine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hoffman_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hoffman-23\">[23]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In December 1947, immediately following the UN partition vote, the <a href=\"/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine\">1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine</a> broke out between the Yishuv and Palestinian Arabs. The Irgun fought together with the Haganah and Lehi during that period. Notable operations in which they took part were the <a href=\"/wiki/Operation_Hametz\" title=\"Operation Hametz\">battle of Jaffa</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_for_Jerusalem\" title=\"Battle for Jerusalem\">Jordanian siege</a> on the <a href=\"/wiki/Jewish_Quarter_(Jerusalem)\" title=\"Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)\">Jewish Quarter</a> in the Old City of <a href=\"/wiki/Jerusalem\" title=\"Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a>.

The event later became known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre\" title=\"Deir Yassin massacre\">Deir Yassin massacre</a>, though Irgun and Lehi sources would deny a massacre took place there.

Begin would not come out of hiding until April 1948, when the British, who still maintained nominal authority over Palestine, were almost totally gone. During the period of revolt, Begin was the most wanted man in Palestine, and <a href=\"/wiki/MI5\" title=\"MI5\">MI5</a> placed a 'dead-or-alive' bounty of <a href=\"/wiki/Pound_sterling\" title=\"Pound sterling\">\u00a3</a>10,000 on his head. Begin had been forced into hiding immediately prior to the declaration of revolt, when Aliza noticed that their house was being watched. He initially lived in a room in the Savoy Hotel, a small hotel in <a href=\"/wiki/Tel_Aviv\" title=\"Tel Aviv\">Tel Aviv</a> whose owner was sympathetic to the Irgun's cause, and his wife and son were smuggled in to join him after two months. He decided to grow a beard and live openly under an assumed name rather than go completely into hiding. He was aided by the fact that the British authorities possessed only two photographs of his likeness, of which one, which they believed to be his military identity card, bore only a slight resemblance to him, according to Begin, and were fed misinformation by <a href=\"/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yaakov Meridor\">Yaakov Meridor</a> that he had had plastic surgery, and were thus confused over his appearance. Due to the British police conducting searches in the hotel's vicinity, he relocated to a Yemenite neighborhood in <a href=\"/wiki/Petah_Tikva\" title=\"Petah Tikva\">Petah Tikva</a>, and after a month, moved to the Hasidof neighborhood near <a href=\"/wiki/Kfar_Sirkin\" title=\"Kfar Sirkin\">Kfar Sirkin</a>, where he pretended to be a lawyer named Yisrael Halperin. After the British searched the area but missed the street where his house was located, Begin and his family moved to a new home on a Tel Aviv side street, where he assumed the name Yisrael Sassover and masqueraded as a rabbi.

Among the issues discussed were logistics of the ship's landing and distribution of the cargo between the military organizations. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the <i>Altalena</i>, there were differences of opinion about the allocation of the cargo.

Begin's failure to respond was a blow to Even's prestige, and a clash was now inevitable. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties. In order to prevent further bloodshed, the Kfar Vitkin settlers initiated negotiations between <a href=\"/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yaakov Meridor\">Yaakov Meridor</a> (Begin's deputy) and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dan_Even&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Dan Even (page does not exist)\">Dan Even</a>, which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.\n</p><p>Begin had meanwhile boarded the <i>Altalena</i>, which was headed for Tel Aviv where the Irgun had more supporters.

Popularly known as the <i>Mahapakh</i> (\"upheaval\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized <a href=\"/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews\" title=\"Mizrahi Jews\">Mizrahi</a> and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and <a href=\"/wiki/Economic_liberalism\" title=\"Economic liberalism\">economically liberal</a> agenda.\n</p><p>The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as <a href=\"/wiki/Totalitarian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Totalitarian\">totalitarian</a> and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly <a href=\"/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews\" title=\"Mizrahi Jews\">Mizrahi</a> working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded <a href=\"/wiki/Centrism\" title=\"Centrism\">centrist</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Democratic_Movement_for_Change\" title=\"Democratic Movement for Change\">Democratic Movement for Change</a> (\"Dash\") headed by <a href=\"/wiki/Yigael_Yadin\" title=\"Yigael Yadin\">Yigael Yadin</a>. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by <a href=\"/wiki/Shimon_Peres\" title=\"Shimon Peres\">Shimon Peres</a> and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats.

Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and <a href=\"/wiki/Haredi_Judaism\" title=\"Haredi Judaism\">ultra-orthodox</a> parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy.

Erlich unveiled a new economic policy that became known as the \"economic transformation\". Under the new plan, the exchange rate would from then on be determined by market forces rather than the government, subsidies for many consumer products were cancelled, <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls\" title=\"Foreign exchange controls\">foreign exchange controls</a> were eased, the <a href=\"/wiki/Value_added_tax\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Value added tax\">VAT</a> tax was raised while the travel tax was cancelled, and customs duties were lowered to encourage imports of more products. The plan generated some improvement; cheap and high-quality imported products began to fill consumer shelves, the business sector benefited greatly, and the stock market recorded rising share prices. However, the program did not improve the lives of the Israeli people as Begin had hoped. The combination of the increased VAT, the end of subsidies, and a rise in the U.S. dollar exchange rate set off a wave of inflation and price increases. In particular, the fact that government spending was not significantly reduced in tandem with the liberalization program triggered a massive bout of inflation. On 17 July 1978, the Israeli cabinet met to discuss rising inflation, but Begin, declaring that \"you cannot manage economics over the housewife's back\", halted all proposals. In the end, the government decided not to take any actions and allow inflation to ride its course. Begin and his other ministers did not internalize the full meaning of the liberalization plan. As a result, he blocked attempts by Erlich to lower government spending and government plans to privatize public-sector enterprises out of fear of harming the weaker sectors of society, allowing the privatization of only eighteen government companies during his six-year tenure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-benn_52-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-benn-52\">[52]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">[53]</a></sup> In 1983, shortly before Begin's resignation, a major <a href=\"/wiki/1983_Israel_bank_stock_crisis\" title=\"1983 Israel bank stock crisis\">financial crisis</a> hit Israel after the stocks of the country's four largest banks collapsed and were subsequently nationalized by the state.

In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their <a href=\"/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares\" title=\"Ordinary least squares\">OLS estimates</a><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup> and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup> Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the <a href=\"/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)\" title=\"Draft lottery (1969)\">Vietnam-era draft lottery</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></sup> However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]</a></sup> Angrist further used variation in U.S. compulsory schooling laws in research with <a href=\"/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu\" title=\"Daron Acemoglu\">Daron Acemoglu</a> in order to estimate human-capital <a href=\"/wiki/Externalities\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Externalities\">externalities</a>, which they found to be about 1% and not statistically significant.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup> Angrist has also studied the strong decrease in the economic returns to schooling in the <a href=\"/wiki/West_Bank\" title=\"West Bank\">West Bank</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Gaza_Strip\" title=\"Gaza Strip\">Gaza Strip</a> in the 1980s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]</a></sup> Together with Lavy, Angrist has also explored the returns to schooling in <a href=\"/wiki/Morocco\" title=\"Morocco\">Morocco</a>, exploiting a change in its language of instruction from  French to Arabic to find that policy substantially reduced Moroccan youths' returns to schooling by deteriorating their French writing skills.<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">[27]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another strand of Angrist's research in the economics of education concerns the impact of various inputs and rules on learning. For instance, in further work with Lavy, Angrist exploited <a href=\"/wiki/Maimonides%27_rule\" title=\"Maimonides' rule\">Maimonides' rule</a>, which limits class size to 40 students, in order to study the impact of class size on scholastic achievement in <a href=\"/wiki/Israel\" title=\"Israel\">Israeli</a> schools, finding that class size reduction substantially increase test scores for 4th and 5th graders, albeit not for 3rd graders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">[28]</a></sup> In further research at Israeli schools, they find that teacher training can cost-effectively improve students' test scores (at least in secular schools),<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">[29]</a></sup> that computer-aided instruction doesn't <sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[30]</a></sup> and that cash incentives raised high school achievement among girls (by inducing them to increase time invested into exam preparation) but were ineffective for boys.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">[31]</a></sup> Similarly, in a study by Angrist, <a href=\"/wiki/Philip_Oreopoulos\" title=\"Philip Oreopoulos\">Philip Oreopoulos</a> and Daniel Lang comparing the impact of academic support services, financial incentives and a combination of both on <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Canadian\">Canadian</a> college first-year students, the combined treatment raised the grades of women throughout their first and second years but had no impact on men.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]</a></sup> In research on <a href=\"/wiki/School_vouchers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"School

school, and to score 0.2 standard deviations higher on tests, suggesting that the vouchers' benefits likely exceeded their $24 cost.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[34]</a></sup> Another subject of Angrist's research are peer effects in education,<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">[35]</a></sup> which he has e.g. explored with <a href=\"/wiki/Kevin_Lang\" title=\"Kevin Lang\">Kevin Lang</a> in the context of <a

class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">[36]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">[37]</a></sup> With regard to the effect of teacher testing, which Angrist has studied with Jonathan Guryan in the U.S., he finds that state-mandated teacher testing raises teachers' wages without raising their quality, though it decreases teacher diversity by reducing the fraction of new teachers who are <a href=\"/wiki/Hispanic\" title=\"Hispanic\">Hispanic</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">[38]</a></sup> In work with Lavy and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Analia_Schlosser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Analia Schlosser (page does not exist)\">Analia Schlosser</a>, Angrist has also explored <a href=\"/wiki/Gary_Becker\" title=\"Gary Becker\">Becker's</a> hypothesis on a trade-off between child quality and quantity by exploiting variation in twin births and parental preferences for compositions of siblings of mixed sexes, with evidence rejecting the hypothesis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">[39]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Since the late 2000s, Angrist has conducted extensive research on <a href=\"/wiki/Charter_school\" title=\"Charter school\">charter schools</a> in the U.S. with Pathak, Abdulkadiroglu, <a href=\"/wiki/Susan_Dynarski\" title=\"Susan Dynarski\">Susan Dynarski</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Kane_(economist)\" title=\"Thomas Kane (economist)\">Thomas Kane</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Walters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Christopher Walters (page does not exist)\">Christopher Walters</a>. For instance, studying the <a href=\"/wiki/KIPP_Lynn_Academy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"KIPP Lynn Academy\">KIPP Lynn Academy</a>, they estimate that KIPP Lynn attendance increased students' math scores by 0.35 SD and their <a href=\"/wiki/English_(language)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"English (language)\">English</a> scores by 0.12 SD,<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">[40]</a></sup> with most of the gains accruing to students with limited English proficiency or special education needs or those who scored low at baseline.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">[41]</a></sup> Beyond KIPP Lynn, they find attendance to Boston charter schools to generally increase test scores for middle and high school students, especially for schools with binding assignment lotteries, whereas pilot schools (public schools covered by some collective bargaining provisions and more independence concerning educational policies) generally have at best statistically insignificant or small effects on students' test scores.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">[42]</a></sup> Further research has attributed the relative efficacy of urban charter schools to these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education which emphasizes student discipline and behaviour, traditional reading and math skills, instruction time, and selective teacher hiring.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">[43]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similar to his research on the economics of education, Angrist's research on labor economics also often seeks to exploit quasi-natural experiments to identify causal relationships. In a publication derived from his dissertation, Angrist e.g. exploits the <a href=\"/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)\" title=\"Draft lottery (1969)\">military draft lottery</a> during the <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam_War\" title=\"Vietnam War\">Vietnam War</a> to estimate that fighting in <a href=\"/wiki/Vietnam\" title=\"Vietnam\">Vietnam</a> reduced veterans' lifetime earnings by about 15% relative to those of nonveterans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">[44]</a></sup> Taking into account <a href=\"/wiki/Veterans%27_benefits\" title=\"Veterans' benefits\">veterans' benefits</a> that subsidized education and training (e.g. through the <a href=\"/wiki/G.I._Bill\" title=\"G.I.
