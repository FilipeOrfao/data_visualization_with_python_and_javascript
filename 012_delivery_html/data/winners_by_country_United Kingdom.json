Irish playwright, critic, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polemic\" title=\"Polemic\">polemicist<\/a> and political activist. His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Man_and_Superman\" title=\"Man and Superman\">Man and Superman<\/a><\/i> (1902), <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Pygmalion_(play)\" title=\"Pygmalion (play)\">Pygmalion<\/a><\/i> (1913) and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Saint_Joan_(play)\" title=\"Saint Joan (play)\">Saint Joan<\/a><\/i> (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary <a href=\"\/wiki\/Satire\" title=\"Satire\">satire<\/a> and historical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Allegory\" title=\"Allegory\">allegory<\/a>, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Literature\">Nobel Prize in Literature<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gradualism_(politics)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gradualism (politics)\">gradualist<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fabian_Society\" title=\"Fabian Society\">Fabian Society<\/a> and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Arms_and_the_Man\" title=\"Arms and the Man\">Arms and the Man<\/a><\/i> in 1894. Influenced by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Henrik_Ibsen\" title=\"Henrik Ibsen\">Henrik Ibsen<\/a>, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Major_Barbara\" title=\"Major Barbara\">Major Barbara<\/a><\/i>, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Doctor%27s_Dilemma_(play)\" title=\"The Doctor's Dilemma (play)\">The Doctor's Dilemma<\/a><\/i>, and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Caesar_and_Cleopatra_(play)\" title=\"Caesar and Cleopatra (play)\">Caesar and Cleopatra<\/a><\/i>.\n<\/p><p>Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted <a href=\"\/wiki\/Eugenics\" title=\"Eugenics\">eugenics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/English-language_spelling_reform\" title=\"English-language spelling reform\">alphabet reform<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vaccine_hesitancy\" title=\"Vaccine hesitancy\">opposed vaccination<\/a> and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/First_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First World War\">First World War<\/a> as equally culpable, and although not a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Irish_republicanism\" title=\"Irish republicanism\">republican<\/a>, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pygmalion_(1938_film)\" title=\"Pygmalion (1938 film)\">filmed version<\/a> of <i>Pygmalion<\/i> for which he received an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay\" title=\"Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\">Academy Award<\/a>. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s, he had largely renounced Fabian Society gradualism, and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left\u2014he expressed admiration for both <a href=\"\/wiki\/Benito_Mussolini\" title=\"Benito Mussolini\">Mussolini<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Joseph_Stalin\" title=\"Joseph Stalin\">Stalin<\/a>. In the final decade of his life, he made fewer public statements but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Order_of_Merit\" title=\"Order of Merit\">Order of Merit<\/a> in 1946.\n<\/p><p>Since Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied, but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Shakespeare\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shakespeare\">Shakespeare<\/a>; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights.

Very soon after his arrival, Born formed close ties to the latter two men.  From the first class he took with Hilbert, Hilbert identified Born as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe, whose function was to write up the class notes for the students' mathematics reading room at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Being class scribe put Born into regular, invaluable contact with Hilbert.  Hilbert became Born's mentor after selecting him to be the first to hold the unpaid, semi-official position of assistant. Born's introduction to Minkowski came through Born's stepmother, Bertha, as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in <a href=\"\/wiki\/K%C3%B6nigsberg\" title=\"K\u00f6nigsberg\">K\u00f6nigsberg<\/a>.  The introduction netted Born invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners.

Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations. Born responded by turning down the offer, as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study.

In 1904, two Germans, A. Kossel and H. D.

His father had deposited \u00a3500 with his London agent to support him. He learnt quickly. Bernal encouraged him to use the X-ray diffraction method to study the structure of proteins.

As a result, in 1970, he was at last able to suggest how it works as a molecular machine: how it switches between its deoxygenated and its oxygenated states, in turn triggering the uptake of oxygen and then its release to the muscles and other organs. Further work over the next two decades refined and corroborated the proposed mechanism. In addition Perutz studied the structural changes in a number of haemoglobin diseases and how these might affect oxygen binding. He hoped that the molecule could be made to function as a drug receptor and that it would be possible to inhibit or reverse the genetic errors such as those that occur in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sickle_cell_anaemia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sickle cell anaemia\">sickle cell anaemia<\/a>. A further interest was the variation of the haemoglobin molecule from species to species to suit differing habitats and patterns of behaviour. In his final years Perutz turned to the study of changes in protein structures implicated in Huntington and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Behavioural_science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Behavioural science\">behavioural science<\/a> studies. The Study of Instinct summarises Tinbergen's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hinde,_R._A._1956_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hinde,_R._A._1956-17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In particular, he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous' behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning.  He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hinde,_R._A._1956_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hinde,_R._A._1956-17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Konrad_Lorenz\" title=\"Konrad Lorenz\">Konrad Lorenz<\/a>. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain.  In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stimulus_(psychology)\" title=\"Stimulus (psychology)\">stimulus<\/a> could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hinde,_R._A._1956_17-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Hinde,_R._A._1956-17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>An example is in his experiments with foraging <a href=\"\/wiki\/Honey_bees\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Honey bees\">honey bees<\/a>. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1973 Tinbergen, along with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Konrad_Lorenz\" title=\"Konrad Lorenz\">Konrad Lorenz<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karl_von_Frisch\" title=\"Karl von Frisch\">Karl von Frisch<\/a>, were awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine<\/a> \"for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]<\/a><\/sup> The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli.

This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.

In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, he helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]<\/a><\/sup> Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup> In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant <a href=\"\/wiki\/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA<\/a> technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering, which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\n<\/p><p>Milstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polypeptides\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polypeptides\">polypeptides<\/a> that contained a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Signal_peptide\" title=\"Signal peptide\">signal sequence<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup> The development of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hybridoma\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hybridoma\">hybridoma<\/a> technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Somatic_hypermutation\" title=\"Somatic hypermutation\">somatic hypermutation<\/a> of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody <a href=\"\/wiki\/Affinity_maturation\" title=\"Affinity maturation\">affinity maturation<\/a>. In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antibodies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antibodies\">antibodies<\/a>, which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in later years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup> for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\n<\/p><p>Quite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries.
