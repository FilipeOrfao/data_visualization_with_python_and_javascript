Its three volumes were published between 1920 and 1922.\n<\/p><p>Sigrid Undset was born on 20 May 1882 in the small town of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kalundborg\" title=\"Kalundborg\">Kalundborg<\/a>, Denmark, at the childhood home of her mother, Charlotte Undset (1855\u20131939, n\u00e9e Anna Maria Charlotte Gyth). Undset was the eldest of three daughters. She and her family moved to Norway when she was two.\n<\/p><p>She grew up in the Norwegian capital, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oslo\" title=\"Oslo\">Oslo<\/a> (or Kristiania, as it was known until 1925). When she was only 11 years old, her father, the Norwegian archaeologist Ingvald Martin Undset (1853\u20131893), died at the age of 40 after a long illness.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The family's economic situation meant that Undset had to give up hope of a university education and after a one-year secretarial course she obtained work at the age of 16 as a secretary with an engineering company in Kristiania, a post she went on to hold for 10 years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>She joined the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Norwegian_Authors%27_Union\" title=\"Norwegian Authors' Union\">Norwegian Authors' Union<\/a> in 1907 and from 1933 through 1935 headed its Literary Council, eventually serving as the union's chairwoman from 1936 until 1940.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>While employed at office work, Undset wrote and studied.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> She was 16 years old when she made her first attempt at writing a novel set in the Nordic <a href=\"\/wiki\/Middle_Ages\" title=\"Middle Ages\">Middle Ages<\/a>. The manuscript, a historical novel set in medieval Denmark, was ready by the time she was 22. It was turned down by the publishing house.\n<\/p><p>Nonetheless, two years later, she completed another manuscript, much less voluminous than the first at only 80 pages. She had put aside the Middle Ages and had instead produced a realistic description of a woman with a middle-class background in contemporary Kristiania. This book was also refused by the publishers at first but it was subsequently accepted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> The title was <i>Fru Marta Oulie<\/i>, and the opening sentence (the words of the book's main character) scandalised readers: \"I have been unfaithful to my husband\".\n<\/p><p>Thus, at the age of 25, Undset made her literary debut with a short <a href=\"\/wiki\/Realism_(arts)\" title=\"Realism (arts)\">realistic<\/a> novel on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Adultery\" title=\"Adultery\">adultery<\/a>, set against a contemporary background. It created a stir, and she found herself ranked as a promising young author in Norway. During the years up to 1919, Undset published a number of novels set in contemporary Kristiania. Her contemporary novels of the period 1907\u20131918 are about the city and its inhabitants. They are stories of working people, of trivial family destinies, of the relationship between parents and children. Her main subjects are women and their love. Or, as she herself put it\u2014in her typically curt and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Irony\" title=\"Irony\">ironic<\/a> manner\u2014\"the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Immoral\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immoral\">immoral<\/a> kind\" (of love).\n<\/p><p>This realistic period culminated in the novels <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Jenny_(novel)\" title=\"Jenny (novel)\">Jenny<\/a><\/i> (1911) and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Vaaren\" title=\"Vaaren\">Vaaren<\/a><\/i> (Spring) (1914). The first is about a woman painter who, as a result of romantic crises, believes that she is wasting her life, and, in the end, commits suicide. The other tells of a woman who succeeds in saving both herself and her love from a serious matrimonial crisis, finally creating a secure family. These books placed Undset apart from the incipient <a href=\"\/wiki\/Women%27s_emancipation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Women's emancipation\">women's emancipation<\/a> movement in Europe.\n<\/p><p>Undset's books sold well from the start, and, after the publication of her third book, she left her office job and prepared to live on her income as a writer. Having been granted a writer's scholarship, she set out on a lengthy journey in Europe. After short stops in Denmark and Germany, she continued to Italy, arriving in Rome in December 1909, where she remained for nine months. Undset's parents had had a close relationship with Rome, and, during her stay there, she followed in their footsteps. The encounter with Southern Europe meant a great deal to her; she made friends within the circle of Scandinavian artists and writers in Rome. <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In Rome, Undset met <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anders_Castus_Svarstad\" title=\"Anders Castus Svarstad\">Anders Castus Svarstad<\/a>, a Norwegian painter, whom she married almost three years later. She was 30; Svarstad was thirteen years older, married, and had a wife and three children in Norway. It was nearly three years before Svarstad got his divorce from his first wife.\n<\/p><p>Undset and Svarstad were married in 1912 and went to stay in London for six months. From London, they returned to Rome, where their first child was born in January 1913. A boy, he was named after his father. In the years up to 1919, she had another child, and the household also took in Svarstad's three children from his first marriage. These were difficult years: her second child, a girl, was <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mentally_handicapped\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mentally handicapped\">mentally handicapped<\/a>, as was one of Svarstad's sons by his first wife.\n<\/p><p>She continued writing, finishing her last realistic novels and collections of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Short_stories\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Short stories\">short stories<\/a>. She also entered the public debate on topical themes: <a href=\"\/wiki\/Women%27s_emancipation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Women's emancipation\">women's emancipation<\/a> and other ethical and moral issues. She had considerable <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polemical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polemical\">polemical<\/a> gifts, and was critical of emancipation as it was developing, and of the moral and ethical decline she felt was threatening in the wake of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/First_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"First World War\">First World War<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1919, she moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lillehammer\" title=\"Lillehammer\">Lillehammer<\/a>, a small town in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gudbrand_Valley\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gudbrand Valley\">Gudbrand Valley<\/a> in southeast Norway, taking her two children with her. She was then expecting her third child. The intention was that she should take a rest at Lillehammer and move back to Kristiania as soon as Svarstad had their new house in order. However, the marriage broke down and a divorce followed. In August 1919, she gave birth to her third child, at Lillehammer. She decided to make Lillehammer her home, and within two years, Bjerkeb\u00e6k, a large house of traditional Norwegian timber architecture, was completed, along with a large fenced garden with views of the town and the villages around. Here she was able to retreat and concentrate on her writing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>After the birth of her third child, and with a secure roof over her head, Undset started a major project: <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Kristin_Lavransdatter\" title=\"Kristin Lavransdatter\">Kristin Lavransdatter<\/a><\/i>. She was at home in the subject matter, having written a short novel at an earlier stage about a period in Norwegian history closer to the Pre-Christian era. She had also published a Norwegian retelling of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arthurian_legends\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Arthurian legends\">Arthurian legends<\/a>. She had studied <a href=\"\/wiki\/Old_Norse\" title=\"Old Norse\">Old Norse<\/a> manuscripts and Medieval <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chronicle\" title=\"Chronicle\">chronicles<\/a> and visited and examined Medieval churches and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Monasteries\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Monasteries\">monasteries<\/a>, both at home and abroad. She was now an authority on the period she was portraying and a very different person from the 22-year-old who had written her first novel about the Middle Ages.\n<\/p><p>It was only after the end of her marriage that Undset wrote her masterpiece. In the years between 1920 and 1927, she first published the three-volume <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Kristin_Lavransdatter\" title=\"Kristin Lavransdatter\">Kristin<\/a><\/i>, and then the 4-volume <i>Olav<\/i> (Audunss\u00f8n), swiftly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Translated\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Translated\">translated<\/a> into English as <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Master_of_Hestviken\" title=\"The Master of Hestviken\">The Master of Hestviken<\/a><\/i>. Simultaneously with this creative process, she was engaged in trying to find meaning in her own life, finding the answer in God.\n<\/p><p>Undset experimented with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Modernist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Modernist\">modernist<\/a> tropes such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)\">stream of consciousness<\/a> in her novel, although the original English translation by Charles Archer excised many of these passages. In 1997, the first volume of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tiina_Nunnally\" title=\"Tiina Nunnally\">Tiina Nunnally<\/a>'s new translation of the work won the <a href=\"\/wiki\/PEN\/Faulkner_Award_for_Fiction\" title=\"PEN\/Faulkner Award for Fiction\">PEN\/Faulkner Award for Fiction<\/a> in the category of translation. The names of each volume were translated by Archer as <i>The Bridal Wreath<\/i>, <i>The Mistress of Husaby<\/i>, and <i>The Cross<\/i>, and by Nunnally as <i>The Wreath<\/i>, <i>The Wife<\/i>, and <i>The Cross<\/i>. Subsequent translation of the Hestviken tetralogy by Nunnally are retitled <i>Olav Audunss\u00f8n (1):Vows<\/i> (<i>The Axe<\/i>)<i>, \u2026(2) Providence<\/i>, (<i>The Snake Pit<\/i>), <i>\u2026(3) Crossroads<\/i> (<i>In The Wilderness<\/i>), and <i>\u2026(4) Winter<\/i> (<i>The Son Avenger<\/i>). \n<\/p><p>Both Undset's parents were <a href=\"\/wiki\/Atheists\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Atheists\">atheists<\/a> and, although, in accord with the norm of the day, she and her two younger sisters were baptised and with their mother regularly attended the local <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lutheran\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lutheran\">Lutheran<\/a> church, the milieu in which they were raised was a thoroughly secular one.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup> Undset spent much of her life as an agnostic, but marriage and the outbreak of the First World War were to change her attitudes. During those difficult years she experienced a crisis of faith, almost imperceptible at first, then increasingly strong. The crisis led her from clear agnostic <a href=\"\/wiki\/Religious_skepticism\" title=\"Religious skepticism\">skepticism<\/a>, by way of painful uneasiness about the ethical decline of the age, towards Christianity.\n<\/p><p>In all her writing, one senses an observant eye for the mystery of life and for that which cannot be explained by reason or the human intellect. At the back of her sober, almost brutal realism, there is always an inkling of something unanswerable. At any rate, this crisis radically changed her views and ideology. Whereas she had once believed that man created God, she eventually came to believe that God created man.\n<\/p><p>Beginning around 1917, Undset developed a passionate interest in the writings of Monsignor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Hugh_Benson\" title=\"Robert Hugh Benson\">Robert Hugh Benson<\/a>, many of whose writings she would later translate into Norwegian.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>However, she did not turn to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Established_church\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Established church\">established<\/a> Lutheran <a href=\"\/wiki\/Church_of_Norway\" title=\"Church of Norway\">Church of Norway<\/a>, where she had been nominally reared. This is because, according to Geir Hasnes, Undset had always considered the Lutheran Church \"anemic\" and \"detested the fact that every minister seemed to preach his personal version of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lutheranism\" title=\"Lutheranism\">Lutheranism<\/a>.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>She was received into the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Catholic_Church_in_Norway\" title=\"Catholic Church in Norway\">Catholic Church<\/a> in November 1924, after thorough instruction from the Catholic priest in her local parish. She was 42 years old. She subsequently became a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Third_Order_of_Saint_Dominic\" title=\"Third Order of Saint Dominic\">lay Dominican<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>It is noteworthy that <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Master_of_Hestviken\" title=\"The Master of Hestviken\">The Master of Hestviken<\/a><\/i>, written immediately after Undset's conversion, takes place in a historical period when Norway was Catholic, that it has very religious themes of the main character's relations with God and his deep feeling of sin, and that the Medieval Catholic Church is presented in a favorable light, with virtually all clergy and monks in the series being positive characters.\n<\/p><p>In Norway, Undset's conversion to Catholicism was not only considered sensational; it was scandalous. It was also noted abroad, where her name was becoming known through the international success of <i>Kristin Lavransdatter<\/i>. At the time, there were very few practicing Catholics in Norway, which was an almost exclusively Lutheran country. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anti-Catholicism\" title=\"Anti-Catholicism\">Anti-Catholicism<\/a> was widespread not only among the Lutheran clergy, but through large sections of the population.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In response, she was swiftly dubbed \"The Mistress of Bjerkeb\u00e6k\" and \"The Catholic Lady\".\n<\/p><p>Undset's essays about <a href=\"\/wiki\/Elizabethan_era\" title=\"Elizabethan era\">Elizabethan era<\/a> English Catholic martyrs <a href=\"\/wiki\/Margaret_Clitherow\" title=\"Margaret Clitherow\">Margaret Clitherow<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Southwell_(Jesuit)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Southwell (Jesuit)\">Robert Southwell<\/a> were collected and published in <i>Stages on the Road<\/i>. Furthermore, Undset's <i>Saga of Saints<\/i> told the whole of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Norwegian_history\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Norwegian history\">Norwegian history<\/a> through the lives of Norwegian Saints and Venerables.\n<\/p><p>In May 1928, Undset travelled to England and visited <a href=\"\/wiki\/G.K._Chesterton\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"G.K.

According to legend, Undset once walked into the office of the manager of the monolithic Aschehoug publishing company. Undset then threw a copy of Chesterton's <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Everlasting_Man\" title=\"The Everlasting Man\">The Everlasting Man<\/a><\/i> on the manager's desk and exclaimed, \"This is the best book ever written! It has to be translated into Norwegian!\" Whether or not the story is merely apocryphal, Undset's own translation of <i>The Everlasting Man<\/i> was published in 1931.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>At the end of this creative eruption, Undset entered calmer waters. After 1929, she completed a series of novels set in contemporary <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oslo\" title=\"Oslo\">Oslo<\/a>, with a strong Catholic element. She selected her themes from the small Catholic community in Norway. But here also, the main theme is love. She also published a number of weighty historical works which put the history of Norway into a sober perspective. In addition, she translated several <a href=\"\/wiki\/Icelandic_sagas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Icelandic sagas\">Icelandic sagas<\/a> into Modern Norwegian and published a number of literary essays, mainly on English literature, of which a long essay on the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bront%C3%AB\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bront\u00eb\">Bront\u00eb<\/a> sisters, and one on <a href=\"\/wiki\/D._H._Lawrence\" title=\"D. H. Lawrence\">D. H. Lawrence<\/a>, are especially worth mentioning.\n<\/p><p>In 1934, she published <i>Eleven Years Old<\/i>, an autobiographical work. With a minimum of camouflage, it tells the story of her own childhood in Kristiania, of her home, rich in intellectual values and love, and of her sick father.\n<\/p><p>At the end of the 1930s, she commenced work on a new historical novel set in 18th century Scandinavia. Only the first volume, <i>Madame Dorthea<\/i>, was published, in 1939. The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_World_War\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second World War\">Second World War<\/a> broke out that same year and proceeded to break her, both as a writer and as a woman.

In 1899, at the opening of the National Theatre, Bj\u00f8rnson received an ovation, and his saga-drama of King <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sigurd_I_of_Norway\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sigurd I of Norway\">Sigurd the Crusader<\/a> was performed at the opening of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nationaltheatret\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nationaltheatret\">Nationaltheatret<\/a> in Oslo.\n<\/p><p>Bj\u00f8rnson was one of the contributors of the anti-Union magazine <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Ringeren\" title=\"Ringeren\">Ringeren<\/a><\/i>, edited by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sigurd_Ibsen\" title=\"Sigurd Ibsen\">Sigurd Ibsen<\/a> in 1898.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>A subject which interested him greatly was the question of the <span title=\"Norwegian-language text\"><i lang=\"no\"><a href=\"\/wiki\/Nynorsk\" title=\"Nynorsk\">bondemaal<\/a><\/i><\/span>, the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the <span title=\"Norwegian-language text\"><i lang=\"no\">dansk-norsk<\/i><\/span> (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Dano-Norwegian\" title=\"Dano-Norwegian\">Dano-Norwegian<\/a>), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bj\u00f8rnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nynorsk\" title=\"Nynorsk\">landsm\u00e5l<\/a>. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bj\u00f8rnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the <span title=\"Norwegian-language text\"><i lang=\"no\">m\u00e5lstr\u00e6v<\/i><\/span> 'language strife' in its extreme form were very effective.\n<\/p><p>His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. Although he seems to have been supportive of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ivar_Aasen\" title=\"Ivar Aasen\">Ivar Aasen<\/a> and friendly towards farmers (in the peasant novels), he later denounced this, and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer's cultivation. \"I can draw a line on the wall. The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more\", he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was \"of the most influential things\" in the initiation of the national day. Bj\u00f8rnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son. During the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. \"To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts,\" he wrote.\n<\/p><p>Bj\u00f8rnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the <a href=\"\/wiki\/%C4%8Cernov%C3%A1_massacre\" title=\"\u010cernov\u00e1 massacre\">\u010cernov\u00e1 massacre<\/a> under the title <i>The greatest industry of Hungary<\/i> \u2013 which was supposedly \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Magyarization\" title=\"Magyarization\">to produce Magyars<\/a>\".\n<\/p><p>He took part in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nordic_sexual_morality_debate\" title=\"Nordic sexual morality debate\">sexual morality debate<\/a> (<span title=\"Norwegian-language text\"><i lang=\"no\">sedelighetsdebatten<\/i><\/span>) of the time, arguing that free love did not allow for the development of positive traits such as self-restraint and a focus on virtue.
