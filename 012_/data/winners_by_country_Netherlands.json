He was the eldest of ten children born to Jacobus van der Waals and Elisabeth van den Berg. His father was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Carpenter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carpenter\">carpenter<\/a> in Leiden. As was usual for all girls and working-class boys in the 19th century, he did not go to the kind of secondary school that would have given him the right to enter university. Instead he went to a school of \u201cadvanced primary education\u201d, which he finished at the age of fifteen. He then became a teacher's apprentice in an elementary school. Between 1856 and 1861 he followed courses and gained the necessary qualifications to become a primary school teacher and head teacher.\n<\/p><p>In 1862, he began to attend lectures in mathematics, physics and astronomy at the university in his city of birth, although he was not qualified to be enrolled as a regular student in part because of his lack of education in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Classical_language\" title=\"Classical language\">classical languages<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> However, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leiden_University\" title=\"Leiden University\">Leiden University<\/a> had a provision that enabled outside students to take up to four courses a year. In 1863 the Dutch government started a new kind of secondary school (HBS, a school aiming at the children of the higher middle classes). Van der Waals\u2014at that time head of an elementary school\u2014wanted to become a HBS teacher in mathematics and physics and spent two  years studying  in his spare time for the required examinations.\n<\/p><p>In 1865, he was appointed as a physics teacher at the HBS in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Deventer\" title=\"Deventer\">Deventer<\/a> and in 1866, he received such a position in <a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Hague\" title=\"The Hague\">The Hague<\/a>, which was close enough to Leiden to allow Van der Waals to resume his courses at the university there. In September 1865, just before moving to Deventer, Van der Waals married the eighteen-year-old Anna Magdalena Smit.\n<\/p><p>Van der Waals still lacked the knowledge of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Classical_languages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Classical languages\">classical languages<\/a> that would have given him the right to enter university as a regular student and to take examinations. However, it so happened that the law regulating the university entrance was changed and dispensation from the study of classical languages could be given by the minister of education. Van der Waals was given this dispensation and passed the qualification exams in physics and mathematics for <a href=\"\/wiki\/Doctoral_studies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Doctoral studies\">doctoral studies<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>At Leiden University, on June 14, 1873, he defended his doctoral thesis <i>Over de Continu\u00efteit van den Gas- en Vloeistoftoestand<\/i> (on the continuity of the gaseous and liquid state) under <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pieter_Rijke\" title=\"Pieter Rijke\">Pieter Rijke<\/a>.

Until his retirement at the age of 70, Van der Waals remained at the Amsterdam University. He was succeeded by his son Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Jr., who also was a theoretical physicist. In 1910, at the age of 72, Van der Waals was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. He died at the age of 85 on March 8, 1923.\n<\/p><p>The main interest of Van der Waals was in the field of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Thermodynamics\" title=\"Thermodynamics\">thermodynamics<\/a>. He was influenced by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Rudolf_Clausius\" title=\"Rudolf Clausius\">Rudolf Clausius<\/a>'s 1857 treatise entitled <i>\u00dcber die Art der Bewegung, welche wir W\u00e4rme nennen<\/i> (<i>On the Kind of Motion which we Call Heat<\/i>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-vdW1910nobel_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-vdW1910nobel-13\">[12]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[13]<\/a><\/sup> Van der Waals was later greatly influenced by the writings of <a href=\"\/wiki\/James_Clerk_Maxwell\" title=\"James Clerk Maxwell\">James Clerk Maxwell<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ludwig_Boltzmann\" title=\"Ludwig Boltzmann\">Ludwig Boltzmann<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Willard_Gibbs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Willard Gibbs\">Willard Gibbs<\/a>. Clausius's work led him to look for an explanation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Thomas_Andrews_(scientist)\" title=\"Thomas Andrews (scientist)\">Thomas Andrews<\/a>'s experiments that had revealed, in 1869, the existence of critical temperatures in fluids.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Andrews1869_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Andrews1869-15\">[14]<\/a><\/sup> He managed to give a semi-quantitative description of the phenomena of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Condensation\" title=\"Condensation\">condensation<\/a> and critical temperatures in his 1873 thesis, entitled <i>Over de Continu\u00efteit van den Gas- en Vloeistoftoestand<\/i> (On the continuity of the gas and liquid state).<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[15]<\/a><\/sup> This dissertation represented a hallmark in physics and was immediately recognized as such, e.g. by <a href=\"\/wiki\/James_Clerk_Maxwell\" title=\"James Clerk Maxwell\">James Clerk Maxwell<\/a> who reviewed it in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nature_(journal)\" title=\"Nature (journal)\">Nature<\/a><sup id=\"cite_ref-Maxwell1874_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Maxwell1874-17\">[16]<\/a><\/sup> in a laudatory manner.\n<\/p><p>In this thesis he derived  the equation of state bearing his name. This work gave a model in which the liquid and the gas phase of a substance merge into each other in a continuous manner. It shows that the two phases are of the same nature. In deriving his equation of state Van der Waals assumed not only the existence of molecules (the existence of atoms was disputed at the time<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[17]<\/a><\/sup>), but also that they are of finite size and  attract each other. Since he was one of the first to postulate an intermolecular force, however rudimentary, such a force is now sometimes called a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Van_der_Waals_force\" title=\"Van der Waals force\">Van der Waals force<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>A second major discovery was the 1880 the Law of Corresponding States, which showed that the Van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume, and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances (see <a href=\"\/wiki\/Van_der_Waals_equation#Reduced_form\" title=\"Van der Waals equation\">Van der Waals equation<\/a>.) The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Compound_(chemistry)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Compound (chemistry)\">compound<\/a>-specific constants <i>a<\/i> and <i>b<\/i> in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities.

Beginning in 1901, Einthoven completed a series of prototypes of a <a href=\"\/wiki\/String_galvanometer\" title=\"String galvanometer\">string galvanometer<\/a>. This device used a very thin filament of conductive wire passing between very strong <a href=\"\/wiki\/Electromagnet\" title=\"Electromagnet\">electromagnets<\/a>. When a current passed through the filament, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Magnetic_field\" title=\"Magnetic field\">magnetic field<\/a> created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a moving roll of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing the movement of the string. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required five people to operate it and weighed some 270 kilograms. This device increased the sensitivity of the standard <a href=\"\/wiki\/Galvanometer\" title=\"Galvanometer\">galvanometer<\/a> so that the electrical activity of the heart could be measured despite the insulation of flesh and bones.

We have seen that he showed himself to be loyal to the dominant political system, first in the Third Reich and then in the United States, while at the same time keeping the back door open: in the Third Reich by retaining his Dutch nationality, in the United States by attempting to secretly maintain some contacts with Nazi Germany via the Foreign Office.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>It concludes that Debye's actions in 1933\u201345 were based on the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw research in physics as generating blessings for humankind. The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others. The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG <i>Heil Hitler<\/i> letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup> The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it was, for him, simply a confirmation of an existing situation. The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil. Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an escape hatch, for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed.\n<\/p><p>Yet, the report also states that the picture of Debye should not be oversimplified as Debye's actions were also motivated by his loyalty to his daughter, who had remained in Berlin. In general, Debye developed a survival method of ambiguity, that \"could pull the wool over people's eyes\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In January 2008 the Terlouw Commission advised <i>the Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to continue to use Peter Debye\u2019s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht<\/i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup> The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Collaborationism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Collaborationism\">collaborator<\/a>, and yet also was not a resistance hero. He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic with respect to the pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics. With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission  concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable. The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein's honorary membership, emphasizing  the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken. The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself. Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history. Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report <i>since no bad faith on Debye\u2019s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed<\/i> and recommended that the University of Utrecht retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize. Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, Maastricht University did not. But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded. The City of Maastricht, Debye's birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square.\n<\/p><p>In a 2010 publication Jurrie Reiding asserts that Debye may have been an <a href=\"\/wiki\/MI6\" title=\"MI6\">MI6<\/a> spy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[34]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">[35]<\/a><\/sup> Reiding discovered that Debye was befriended by the well-documented spy <a href=\"\/wiki\/Paul_Rosbaud\" title=\"Paul Rosbaud\">Paul Rosbaud<\/a>. They first met around 1930 when they were both working as editors for two scientific journals. They collaborated in the escape of Lise Meitner in 1938. According to Reiding, Debye was well connected in German scientific and industrial circles and could have provided MI6 with valuable information. For example, as board member of the German Academy for Aviation Research he was acquainted with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring\" title=\"Hermann G\u00f6ring\">Hermann G\u00f6ring<\/a>. Reiding also offers an explanation for Debye's hasty departure on 16 January 1940 for the United States: the date coincided with the planned (but later delayed) <a href=\"\/wiki\/German_invasion_of_the_Netherlands\" title=\"German invasion of the Netherlands\">German invasion of the Netherlands<\/a> a day later, information possibly provided to him by Rosbaud.\n<\/p><p>This hypothesis is contested by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Philip_Ball\" title=\"Philip Ball\">Philip Ball<\/a>, as he notes that friendship with Rosbaud is no gauge of Debye's political stance.

He opted for Utrecht instead of the much closer Leiden, because his uncle was a professor there and he wanted to attend his lectures. Because he was so focused on science, his father insisted that he join the Utrechtsch Studenten Corps, a student association, in the hope that he would do something else besides studying. This worked to some extent; during his studies he was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Coxswain\" title=\"Coxswain\">coxswain<\/a> with their rowing club \"Triton\" and organized a national congress for science students with their science discussion club \"Christiaan Huygens\".\n<\/p><p>In the course of his studies he decided he wanted to go into what he perceived as the heart of theoretical physics, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Elementary_particles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elementary particles\">elementary particles<\/a>. His uncle had grown to dislike the subject and in particular its practitioners, so when it became time to write his <i>doctoraalscriptie<\/i> (former name of the Dutch equivalent of a master's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Thesis\" title=\"Thesis\">thesis<\/a>) in 1968, \u2019t Hooft turned to the newly appointed professor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Martinus_Veltman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Martinus Veltman\">Martinus Veltman<\/a>, who specialized in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory\" title=\"Yang\u2013Mills theory\">Yang\u2013Mills theory<\/a>, a relatively fringe subject at the time because it was thought that these could not be <a href=\"\/wiki\/Renormalization\" title=\"Renormalization\">renormalized<\/a>.

He would work on the same subject Veltman was working on, the renormalization of Yang\u2013Mills theories. In 1971 his first paper was published.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup> In it he showed how to renormalize massless Yang\u2013Mills fields, and was able to derive relations between amplitudes, which would be generalized by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Andrei_Slavnov\" title=\"Andrei Slavnov\">Andrei Slavnov<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/John_Clayton_Taylor\" title=\"John Clayton Taylor\">John C.

Soon \u2019t Hooft's second paper was ready to be published,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> in which he showed that Yang\u2013Mills theories with massive fields due to spontaneous symmetry breaking could be renormalized.

In this time he became interested in the possibility that the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Strong_interaction\" title=\"Strong interaction\">strong interaction<\/a> could be described as a massless Yang\u2013Mills theory, i.e. one of a type that he had just proved to be renormalizable and hence be susceptible to detailed calculation and comparison with experiment.\n<\/p><p>According to \u2019t Hooft's calculations, this type of theory possessed just the right kind of scaling properties (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Asymptotic_freedom\" title=\"Asymptotic freedom\">asymptotic freedom<\/a>) that this theory should have according to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Deep_inelastic_scattering\" title=\"Deep inelastic scattering\">deep inelastic scattering<\/a> experiments.

His elder brother <a href=\"\/wiki\/Johann_Frederik_Eijkman\" title=\"Johann Frederik Eijkman\">Johann Frederik Eijkman<\/a> (1851\u20131915) was also a chemist.\n<\/p><p>A year later, in 1859, the Eijkman family moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Zaandam\" title=\"Zaandam\">Zaandam<\/a>, where his father was appointed head of a newly founded school for advanced elementary education. It was here that Christiaan and his brothers received their early education. In 1875, after taking his preliminary examinations, Eijkman became a student at the Military Medical School of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Amsterdam\" title=\"University of Amsterdam\">University of Amsterdam<\/a>, where he was trained as a medical officer for the Netherlands Indies Army, passing through all his examinations with honours.\n<\/p><p>From 1879 to 1881, he was an assistant of T. Place, Professor of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Physiology\" title=\"Physiology\">Physiology<\/a>, during which time he wrote his thesis <i>On Polarization of the Nerves<\/i>, which gained him his doctoral degree, with honours, on 13 July 1883.\n<\/p><p>In 1883, Eijkman left the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Netherlands\" title=\"Netherlands\">Netherlands<\/a> for The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dutch_East_Indies\" title=\"Dutch East Indies\">Dutch East Indies<\/a>, where he was made medical officer of health, first in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Semarang\" title=\"Semarang\">Semarang<\/a>, then later at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tjilatjap\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tjilatjap\">Tjilatjap<\/a>, a small village on the south coast of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Java\" title=\"Java\">Java<\/a>, and at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Padangsidempuan\" title=\"Padangsidempuan\">Padang Sidempoean<\/a> in Northern <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sumatra\" title=\"Sumatra\">Sumatra<\/a>. It was at Tjilatjap that he caught <a href=\"\/wiki\/Malaria\" title=\"Malaria\">malaria<\/a>, which later so impaired his health that in 1885 he had to return to Europe on sick-leave.\n<\/p><p>For Eijkman this was to prove a lucky event, as it enabled him to work in E. Forster's laboratory in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Amsterdam\" title=\"Amsterdam\">Amsterdam<\/a>, and also in Robert Koch's bacteriological laboratory in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Berlin\" title=\"Berlin\">Berlin<\/a>; here he came into contact with <a href=\"\/wiki\/C._A._Pekelharing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"C. A. Pekelharing\">C. A. Pekelharing<\/a> and C. Winkler, who were visiting the German capital before their departure to the Indies. In this way medical officer Christiaan Eijkman was seconded as assistant to the Pekelharing-Winkler mission, together with his colleague M. B. Romeny. This mission had been sent out by the Dutch Government to conduct investigations into <a href=\"\/wiki\/Beriberi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beriberi\">Beriberi<\/a>, a disease which at that time was causing havoc in that region.\n<\/p><p>In 1887, Pekelharing and Winkler were recalled, but before their departure Pekelharing proposed to the Governor General that the laboratory which had been temporarily set up for the Commission in the Military Hospital in Batavia should be made permanent. This proposal was readily accepted, and Christiaan Eijkman was appointed its first director. Now he was able to devote himself entirely to science.\n<\/p><p>Eijkman was Director of the \"Geneeskundig Laboratorium\" (Medical Laboratory) from 15 January 1888 to 4 March 1896, and during that time he made a number of his most important researches. These dealt first of all with the physiology of people living in tropical regions. He was able to demonstrate that a number of theories had no factual basis. Firstly he proved that in the blood of Europeans living in the tropics the number of red corpuscles, the specific gravity, the serum, and the water content, undergo no change, at least when the blood is not affected by disease which will ultimately lead to anaemia. Comparing the metabolism of the European with that of the native, he found that in the tropics as well in the temperate zone, this is entirely governed by the work carried out. Neither could he find any disparity in respiratory metabolism, perspiration, and temperature regulation. Thus Eijkman put an end to a number of speculations on the acclimatization of Europeans in the tropics which had hitherto necessitated the taking of various precautions.\n<\/p><p>Eijkman had been sent to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dutch_East_Indies\" title=\"Dutch East Indies\">Dutch East Indies<\/a> to study <a href=\"\/wiki\/Beriberi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beriberi\">beriberi<\/a>, a disease of the peripheral nerves, but his discovery of the cause was accidental. He noticed the symptoms of beriberi in some chickens used in his laboratory when their feed had been altered for a few months. During that time, chickens in the laboratory had been fed leftover rice from military rations, until a new cook refused to allow military rice to be fed to civilian animals. Rice was then purchased from another source, and the birds soon recovered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup> During the months that the chickens developed beriberi, the feed had been polished rice, and when the birds' diet was switched back to unpolished rice, the birds recovered in a few days. Eijkman surmised that <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polished_rice\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polished rice\">polished rice<\/a> lacked a dietary component found in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Brown_rice\" title=\"Brown rice\">unpolished rice<\/a>, and that beriberi was caused by depriving the body of this component, which he called \"the anti-beriberi factor\". Subsequently, Eijkman was able to prove that the disease was not caused by blood contamination, respiratory metabolism, perspiration, or seasonal or temperature variation. He suspected the disease was caused by an unknown bacterium.\n<\/p><p>Eijkman was unable to continue his research due to ill health, but a study by his friend <a href=\"\/wiki\/Adolphe_Vorderman\" title=\"Adolphe Vorderman\">Adolphe Vorderman<\/a> confirmed the link between polished rice and the disease. Eventually it was determined the missing compound that was causing beriberi was <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vitamin_B1\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vitamin B1\">vitamin B<sub>1<\/sub><\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Thiamine\" title=\"Thiamine\">thiamine<\/a>. Chemist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Casimir_Funk\" title=\"Casimir Funk\">Casimir Funk<\/a> shortened the term \"vital amine\" to coin a new word, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vitamin\" title=\"Vitamin\">vitamin<\/a>. For his contributions to the discovery of antineuritic vitamins, Eijkman won the 1929 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_for_Medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobel Prize for Medicine\">Nobel Prize for Medicine<\/a>, sharing the prize with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sir_Frederick_Hopkins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Frederick Hopkins\">Sir Frederick Hopkins<\/a>. Funk, perhaps unfairly, was never given full credit for his work.\n<\/p><p>In addition to his work on beriberi, he occupied himself with other problems such as arach <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fermentation_(biochemistry)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fermentation (biochemistry)\">fermentation<\/a>, and indeed still had time to write two textbooks for his students at the Java Medical School, one on physiology and the other on organic chemistry.\n<\/p><p>In 1898 he became successor to G. van Overbeek de Meyer, as Professor in Hygiene and Forensic Medicine at Utrecht. His inaugural speech was entitled <i>Over Gezondheid en Ziekten in Tropische Gewesten<\/i> (On health and diseases in tropical regions). At Utrecht, Eijkman turned to the study of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bacteriology\" title=\"Bacteriology\">bacteriology<\/a>, and carried out his well-known fermentation test, by means of which it can be readily established if water has been polluted by human and animal defecation containing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Coli_bacilli\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Coli bacilli\">coli bacilli<\/a>. Another research was into the rate of mortality of bacteria as a result of various external factors, whereby he was able to show that this process could not be represented by a logarithmic curve. This was followed by his investigation of the phenomenon that the rate of growth of bacteria on solid substratum often decreases, finally coming to a halt. Beyerinck's auxanographic method was applied on several occasions by Eijkman, as for example during the secretion of enzymes which break down casein or bring about <a href=\"\/wiki\/Haemolysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Haemolysis\">haemolysis<\/a>, whereby he could demonstrate the hydrolysis of fats under the influence of lipases.\n<\/p><p>Eijkman did not confine himself to the University. He also engaged himself in problems of water supply, housing, school hygiene, physical education. As a member of the Gezondheidsraad (Health Council) and the Gezondheidscommissie (Health Commission), he participated in the struggle against <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alcoholism\" title=\"Alcoholism\">alcoholism<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tuberculosis\" title=\"Tuberculosis\">tuberculosis<\/a>. He was the founder of the Vereeniging tot Bestrijding van de Tuberculose (Society for the struggle against tuberculosis ).\n<\/p><p>He died in Utrecht, on 5 November 1930, after a protracted illness.\n<\/p><p>In 1907, Eijkman was appointed Member of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences\" title=\"Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences\">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences<\/a>, after having been Correspondent since 1895.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> The Dutch Government conferred upon him several orders of knighthood, whereas on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his professorship a fund was  established to enable the awarding of the Eijkman Medal.

This research involved an investigation of the effect of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Magnetic_field\" title=\"Magnetic field\">magnetic fields<\/a> on a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Light\" title=\"Light\">light<\/a> source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components in the presence of a magnetic field.
