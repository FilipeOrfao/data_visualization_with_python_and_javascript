At the turn of the twentieth century, the Arabic novel took its first steps in a society and culture that discovered this literary genre through the translation of European novels from the nineteenth century.  However, for Naguib Mahfouz, a society as strong and ancient as Egyptian society, having preserved ancient traditions while modernizing, could absorb and incorporate, without fear, some aspects of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Western_culture\" title=\"Western culture\">Western culture<\/a>.  Because this writer listened, above all, in his work, to this Egyptian people, to their intimate adventures and their history.\n<\/p><p>Naguib Mahfouz's novels are characterized by a classic narrative style, characterized by a focus on portraying characters and situations in a very realistic way, with an emphasis on customs, traditions, and social values in Egyptian society, and the accurate embodiment of daily life in Egypt.  Naguib Mahfouz also uses the style of the internal novel, which allows the reader to view the world through the eyes of a central character in the novel.  Naguib Mahfouz's style is also characterized by manipulating time and focusing on the changes that occur in events and people over time.\n<\/p><p>Mahfouz was born in a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Old_Cairo\" title=\"Old Cairo\">Old Cairo<\/a> in 1911.

His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been \"old-fashioned\", was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Al-Azhar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Al-Azhar\">Al-Azhar<\/a> sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Egyptian_Museum\" title=\"Egyptian Museum\">Egyptian Museum<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Egyptian_Pyramids\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Egyptian Pyramids\">Pyramids<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-El-Enany7_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-El-Enany7-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing.

During his tenure as Director General of the IAEA (1997\u20132009), for instance, ElBaradei downplayed claims of possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, which undermined U.S. efforts to press Iran over its safeguards violations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]<\/a><\/sup> According to a 3 July 2003 article in <i>Time<\/i> magazine, ElBaradei also maintained that Iraq's nuclear program had not restarted before the 2003 Iraq War, contradicting claims by the Bush administration.

These initiatives would not simply add more non-proliferation controls, to limit access to weapon-usable nuclear material; they would also provide access to the benefits of nuclear technology for more people in more countries.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">[29]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Non-nuclear-weapon states have been reluctant to embrace these proposals due to a perception that the commercial or strategic interests of nuclear-weapon states motivate the proposals, a perception that the proposals produce a dependency on a limited number of nuclear fuel suppliers, and a concern that the proposal restricts their unalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ASIL_30-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ASIL-30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>ElBaradei's work does not only concentrate on nuclear verification.

At least 50 to 60 percent of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy, but most developing countries do not have enough radiotherapy machines or sufficient numbers of specialized doctors and other health professionals.\" In the first year of operation, PACT provided cancer-treatment capacity in seven member states, using the IAEA's share of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In his speech to the 2008 General Conference, ElBaradei said that \"development activities remain central to our work.

I again emphasize that technical cooperation is not a bargaining chip, part of a political 'balance' between the development and safeguards activities of the agency.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>ElBaradei served on the board of trustees of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/International_Crisis_Group\" title=\"International Crisis Group\">International Crisis Group<\/a>, a non-governmental organization that enjoys an annual budget of over $15 million and is bankrolled by the Carnegie, the Ford Foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as George Soros' Open Society Institute.
