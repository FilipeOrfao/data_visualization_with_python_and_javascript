He remained in Munich for the rest of his career.\n<\/p><p>During 1895, at his laboratory in the W\u00fcrzburg Physical Institute of the University of W\u00fcrzburg, R\u00f6ntgen was investigating the external effects of passing an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Electrical_discharge\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Electrical discharge\">electrical discharge<\/a> through various types of vacuum tube equipment\u2014apparatuses from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heinrich_Hertz\" title=\"Heinrich Hertz\">Heinrich Hertz<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Johann_Hittorf\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Johann Hittorf\">Johann Hittorf<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/William_Crookes\" title=\"William Crookes\">William Crookes<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nikola_Tesla\" title=\"Nikola Tesla\">Nikola Tesla<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Philipp_von_Lenard\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Philipp von Lenard\">Philipp von Lenard<\/a><sup id=\"cite_ref-Nitske_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nitske-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup> In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cathode_rays\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cathode rays\">cathode rays<\/a> to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. R\u00f6ntgen knew that the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet he observed that the invisible cathode rays caused a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fluorescent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fluorescent\">fluorescent<\/a> effect on a small cardboard screen painted with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Platinocyanide\" title=\"Platinocyanide\">barium platinocyanide<\/a> when it was placed close to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aluminium\" title=\"Aluminium\">aluminium<\/a> window.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> It occurred to R\u00f6ntgen that the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Crookes%E2%80%93Hittorf_tube\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube\">Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube<\/a>, which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect.\n<\/p><p>In the late afternoon of 8 November 1895, R\u00f6ntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering similar to the one he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ruhmkorff_coil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ruhmkorff coil\">Ruhmkorff coil<\/a> to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, R\u00f6ntgen darkened the room to test the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Opacity_(optics)\" title=\"Opacity (optics)\">opacity<\/a> of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare for the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that R\u00f6ntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench a few feet away from the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next.\n<\/p><p>Based on the formation of regular shadows, R\u00f6ntgen termed the phenomenon \"rays\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-PaisInward_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PaisInward-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup><sup class=\"reference nowrap\"><span title=\"Page \/ location: 40\">:\u200a40\u200a<\/span><\/sup> As 8 November was a Friday, so he took advantage of the weekend to repeat his experiments and made his first notes. In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed \"X-rays\", using the mathematical designation (\"X\") for something unknown. The new rays came to bear his name in many languages as \"R\u00f6ntgen rays\" (and the associated <a href=\"\/wiki\/Radiography\" title=\"Radiography\">X-ray radiograms<\/a> as \"R\u00f6ntgenograms\").\n<\/p><p>At one point while he was investigating the ability of various materials to stop the rays, R\u00f6ntgen brought a small piece of lead into position while a discharge was occurring. R\u00f6ntgen thus saw the first radiographic image: his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium platinocyanide screen. \n<\/p><p>About six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture\u2014a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Radiograph\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Radiograph\">radiograph<\/a>\u2014using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha's hand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Stoddart_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Stoddart-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed \"I have seen my death!\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Landwehr_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Landwehr-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup> He later took a better picture of his friend <a href=\"\/wiki\/Albert_von_K%C3%B6lliker\" title=\"Albert von K\u00f6lliker\">Albert von K\u00f6lliker<\/a>'s hand at a public lecture.\n<\/p><p>R\u00f6ntgen's original paper, \"On A New Kind of Rays\" (<i>Ueber eine neue Art von Strahlen<\/i>), was published on 28 December 1895. On 5 January 1896, an Austrian newspaper reported R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of a new type of radiation.

Koch\u2019s discovery of the dormant stage, the anthrax spores, allowed him to successfully unravel the mystery behind the anthrax disease. By gaining a better understanding of this pathogen, he was able to shed light on the bacterium\u2019s remarkable resistance against environmental factors (\u201cRobert Koch \u2013 Nobel Lecture\u201d 2018). This groundbreaking achievement marked Koch as the pioneer scientist to discover that a microscopic organism was causing a disease to spread. His findings were especially impressive as they were done in a poorly equipped laboratory in Wollstein. \n<\/p><p><br>\nHe published the discovery in a booklet as \"<i>Die \u00c4tiologie der Milzbrand-Krankheit, Begr\u00fcndet auf die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Bacillus Anthracis<\/i>\" (<i>The Etiology of Anthrax Disease, Based on the Developmental History of Bacillus Anthracis<\/i>) in 1876 while working at in W\u00f6llstein.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup> His publication in 1877 on the structure of anthrax bacterium<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]<\/a><\/sup> marked the first photography of a bacterium.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_15-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup> He discovered the formation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bacterial_spore\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bacterial spore\">spores<\/a> in anthrax bacteria, which could remain dormant under specific conditions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Heinrich_Hermann_Robert_Koch_18-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heinrich_Hermann_Robert_Koch-18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup> However, under optimal conditions, the spores were activated and caused disease.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Heinrich_Hermann_Robert_Koch_18-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heinrich_Hermann_Robert_Koch-18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup> To determine this causative agent, he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides, used dyes to stain the cultures, and observed them through a microscope.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Robert_Koch_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Robert_Koch-25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup> His work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease, rejecting the idea of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spontaneous_generation\" title=\"Spontaneous generation\">spontaneous generation<\/a> and supporting the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Germ_theory_of_disease\" title=\"Germ theory of disease\">germ theory of disease<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Germ_theory_of_disease_22-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Germ_theory_of_disease-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup> \n<\/p><p><br>\n<\/p><p>After graduation in 1866, Koch briefly worked as an assistant  in the General Hospital of Hamburg.

He returned to Germany in 1853, where, with the Italian landscape still fresh in his mind, he wrote the works which first made him famous: his most famous short story, \"L'Arrabbiata\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> (\"The Fury\", 1853, published in 1855); and the <i>Lieder aus Sorrent<\/i> (\"Songs of Sorrento\", 1852\/53). Much of his new writing appeared in the <i>Argo<\/i>, the yearbook of the <i>R\u00fctli<\/i> writers.\n<\/p><p>Emanuel Geibel persuaded the King of Bavaria, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Maximilian_II_of_Bavaria\" title=\"Maximilian II of Bavaria\">Maximilian II<\/a>, to grant Heyse a titular professorship in Munich. Heyse was thus appointed professor of Romance philology, although he never taught at that city's university. After his marriage on 15 May to Margarete Kugler he arrived in Munich on 25 May 1854. At his first audience with the King, Heyse presented his verse tales, <i>Hermen<\/i>, and began a productive life as one of the <i>Nordlichtern<\/i> (\"northern lights\": Geibel, Heyse and Riehl) and establishing another literary society, <i>Die Krokodile<\/i>, which included <a href=\"\/wiki\/Felix_Dahn\" title=\"Felix Dahn\">Felix Dahn<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wilhelm_Hertz\" title=\"Wilhelm Hertz\">Wilhelm Hertz<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hermann_Lingg\" title=\"Hermann Lingg\">Hermann Lingg<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Franz_von_Kobell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Franz von Kobell\">Franz von Kobell<\/a>, the cultural historian <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wilhelm_Heinrich_Riehl\" title=\"Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl\">Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Friedrich_Bodenstedt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Friedrich Bodenstedt\">Friedrich Bodenstedt<\/a>, and the travel writer and art patron <a href=\"\/wiki\/Adolf_Friedrich_von_Schack\" title=\"Adolf Friedrich von Schack\">Adolf Friedrich von Schack<\/a>. In December Heyse began a long correspondence with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Eduard_M%C3%B6rike\" title=\"Eduard M\u00f6rike\">Eduard M\u00f6rike<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>On 22 August 1855, Heyse's first son, Franz, was born. Heyse had four children by his first marriage: Franz (1855\u20131919), Julie or Lulu (Frau Baumgarten, 1857\u20131928), Ernst (1859\u20131871) and Clara (Frau Layriz, 1861\u20131931). In 1859, obligations to the Kugler family led Heyse to take up a position as editor of the <i>Literaturblatt zum deutschen Kunstblatt<\/i>, and he declined a tempting offer from the Grand Duke Carl Alexander von Weimar which would have involved moving to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Thuringia\" title=\"Thuringia\">Thuringia<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>On 30 September 1862, his wife Margarete died in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Meran\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Meran\">Meran<\/a> of a lung illness. He completed the historical drama, <i>Ludwig der Bayer<\/i> \u2013 a Bavarian period piece which Maximilian II had long been eager to see \u2013 but its theatrical production was a failure. Nevertheless, Heyse worked throughout the 1860s on new plays, eventually achieving his greatest success with <i>Kolberg<\/i> (1865).\n<\/p><p>He married Anna Schubart in 1867. Over the next three decades, Heyse continued to write prolifically. Despite a number of bereavements his life was uneventful, and his fame grew steadily until he was a world-famous figure. He was a very early opponent of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Naturalism_(literature)\" title=\"Naturalism (literature)\">naturalism<\/a>, making critical references to it in print long before its influence could be felt in Germany. Younger critics who favoured naturalism made attacks on his writings, to which he replied in <i>Merlin<\/i> (1892): but their influence on the public was negligible. He was dubbed <i>Dichterf\u00fcrst<\/i>, prince of poetry, and he worked tirelessly to promote international understanding within Europe. He was elected an International Member of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/American_Philosophical_Society\" title=\"American Philosophical Society\">American Philosophical Society<\/a> in 1895.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> In 1900, he was named an honorary citizen of Munich, and several special publications honoured his 70th birthday; and in 1910, he was made a member of the nobility, before being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on 10 December.

His parents were Robert and Marie Hauptmann, who ran a hotel in the area. As a youth, Hauptmann had a reputation of being loose with the truth.

Hauptmann had difficulties adjusting himself to his new surroundings in the city. He lived, along with his brother Carl, in a somewhat run-down student boarding house before finding lodging with a pastor.\n<\/p><p>He ran into problems with the Prussian-influenced school. Above all were the strictness of the teachers and the better treatment of his noble classmates. His dislike and numerous illnesses kept him from attending class, which led to his having to repeat his first year. Over time, he came to appreciate Breslau because of the opportunity to visit the theater.\n<\/p><p>In the spring of 1878, Hauptmann left the Realschule to learn agriculture on his uncle's farm in Lohnig (today <a href=\"\/wiki\/%C5%81agiewniki_%C5%9Aredzkie\" title=\"\u0141agiewniki \u015aredzkie\">\u0141agiewniki \u015aredzkie<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gmina_Udanin\" title=\"Gmina Udanin\">Gmina Udanin<\/a>, Poland).<sup id=\"cite_ref-EB1911_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-EB1911-2\">[2]<\/a><\/sup> After a year and a half, however, he had to break off his training.

There he met <a href=\"\/wiki\/Josef_Block\" title=\"Josef Block\">Josef Block<\/a> who became a lifelong friend. He was temporarily expelled for \"poor behavior and insufficient diligence,\" but quickly reinstated on the recommendation of the sculptor and Professor Robert H\u00e4rtel. Hauptmann left the school in 1882.\n<\/p><p>For his brother's wedding, he wrote a short play, <i>Liebesfr\u00fchling<\/i>, which was performed on the night before. Also at the wedding, he met the bride's sister, Marie Thienemann.

They visited the island of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hiddensee\" title=\"Hiddensee\">Hiddensee<\/a>, which would become a favorite retreat of Hauptmann's. Because the city air bothered Gerhart's lungs, the couple spent the first four years of their marriage in the town of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Erkner\" title=\"Erkner\">Erkner<\/a>, where their three sons were born. In 1889, they moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Charlottenburg\" title=\"Charlottenburg\">Charlottenburg<\/a> in Berlin.

In September 1904, they were married; this second marriage lasted until his death, though it was thrown into a serious crisis in 1905 and 1906 by his affair with a 16-year-old actress, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ida_Orloff\" title=\"Ida Orloff\">Ida Orloff<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1910, Hauptmann's first full-length novel was published, <i>The Fool in Christ, Emanuel Quint<\/i>, which told the story of a wandering preacher who mixed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Solar_deity\" title=\"Solar deity\">sun worship<\/a> with Christianity. His 1912 novel, <i>Atlantis<\/i>, became the basis for a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Atlantis_(1913_film)\" title=\"Atlantis (1913 film)\">Danish silent film<\/a> of the same name.

Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There were only a few cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.\n<\/p><p>Braun invented the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phased_array\" title=\"Phased array\">phased array<\/a> antenna in 1905.

The prize awarded to Braun in 1909 depicts this design. Braun experimented at first at the University of Strasbourg. Not before long he bridged a distance of 42\u00a0km to the city of Mutzig. In spring 1899, Braun, accompanied by his colleagues Cantor and Zenneck, went to Cuxhaven to continue their experiments at the North Sea. On 24 September 1900 radio telegraphy signals were exchanged regularly with the island of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heligoland\" title=\"Heligoland\">Heligoland<\/a> over a distance of 62\u00a0km.

He realized that this is manifestation of the concept of chemical catalysis first articulated by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Berzelius\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Berzelius\">Berzelius<\/a>. Ostwald articulated the idea that a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction without being a part of either the reactants or the products. Ostwald's advances in the understanding of chemical catalysis were widely applicable in biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis and also in many industrial processes. A catalyst is used in the nitric acid process that Ostwald invented.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Catalysis_18-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Catalysis-18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Ostwald studied the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Crystallization\" title=\"Crystallization\">crystallization<\/a> behavior of solids, especially those solids that are capable of crystallizing in different forms, in the phenomenon known as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polymorphism_(materials_science)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polymorphism (materials science)\">polymorphism<\/a>. He discovered that solids do not necessarily crystallize in their most thermodynamically stable form but instead sometimes crystallize preferentially in other forms dependent on the relative rates of crystallization of each polymorphic form. Ostwald found that the relative rates were dependent on the surface tension between the solid polymorph and the liquid form. Many common materials exhibit this type of behavior, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Minerals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minerals\">minerals<\/a> and various <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organic_compounds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organic compounds\">organic compounds<\/a>.

While the a non-thermodynamically preferred polymorph may crystallize first, more thermodynamically stable forms can continue to develop as the solution ages. Often this results in large crystals forming, since they are more thermodynamically stable than are large numbers of small crystals. This phenomenon came to be known as Ostwald Ripening and is observed in many situations. An everyday example is the gritty texture that ice cream develops as it ages. On a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Geologic_timescale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Geologic timescale\">geologic timescale<\/a>, many <a href=\"\/wiki\/Minerals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minerals\">minerals<\/a> exhibit Ostwald Ripening as their crystal forms evolve as the mineral ages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Clay_Minerals_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Clay_Minerals-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Related to solubility and crystallization was Ostwald's finding that dissolution of a solid depends on the size of the crystal. When the crystals are small, typically less than a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Micron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Micron\">micron<\/a>, the solubility of the solid in the solution phase is increased. Ostwald quantified this effect mathematically in a relationship that became known as the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ostwald-Freundlich_equation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ostwald-Freundlich equation\">Ostwald-Freundlich equation<\/a>. Ostwald first published his finding in 1900, and his mathematical equation was refined by German chemist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Herbert_Freundlich\" title=\"Herbert Freundlich\">Herbert Freundlich<\/a> in 1909. This mathematical relationship also applies to the partial pressure of substance in the system. The Ostwald-Freundlich equation takes into account the surface tension of the particle in the system, in addition to curvature and temperature. The size dependence of solubility is sometimes utilized in the formulation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pharmaceuticals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pharmaceuticals\">pharmaceuticals<\/a> that have low solubility so as to enhance their uptake by the patient.

Upon his return he established a private medical practice and small laboratory in Berlin-Steglitz. In 1891, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Koch\" title=\"Robert Koch\">Robert Koch<\/a> invited Ehrlich to join the staff at his Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases, where in 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (<i>Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung<\/i>), was established for Ehrlich's specialization. Ehrlich was named its founding director.\n<\/p><p>In 1899 his institute moved to Frankfurt am Main and was renamed the Institute of Experimental Therapy (<i>Institut f\u00fcr experimentelle Therapie<\/i>). One of his important collaborators there was Max Neisser.

During his studies in Strassburg under the anatomist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Waldeyer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer\">Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer<\/a>, Ehrlich continued the research started by his cousin in pigments and staining tissues for microscopic study. He spent his eighth university semester in Freiburg im Breisgau investigating primarily the red dye dahlia (monophenylrosanilin), giving rise to his first publication.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1878 he followed his dissertation supervisor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Julius_Friedrich_Cohnheim\" title=\"Julius Friedrich Cohnheim\">Julius Friedrich Cohnheim<\/a> to Leipzig, and that year obtained a doctorate with a dissertation entitled \"Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Histological Staining\" (<i>Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie und Praxis der histologischen F\u00e4rbung<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>One of the most outstanding results of his dissertation investigations was the discovery of a new cell type. Ehrlich discovered in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Protoplasm\" title=\"Protoplasm\">protoplasm<\/a> of supposed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Plasma_cells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Plasma cells\">plasma cells<\/a> a granulate which could be made visible with the help of an alkaline dye. He thought this granulate was a sign of good nourishment, and accordingly named these cells <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mast_cell\" title=\"Mast cell\">mast cells<\/a>, (from the German word for an animal-fattening feed, <i>Mast<\/i>). This focus on chemistry was unusual for a medical dissertation. In it, Ehrlich presented the entire spectrum of known staining techniques and the chemistry of the pigments employed.\nWhile he was at the Charit\u00e9, Ehrlich elaborated upon the differentiation of white blood cells according to their different granules. A precondition was a dry specimen technique, which he also developed. A drop of blood placed between two glass slides and heated over a Bunsen burner fixed the blood cells while still allowing them to be stained. Ehrlich used both alkaline and acid dyes, and also created new \"neutral\" dyes. For the first time this made it possible to differentiate the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lymphocyte\" title=\"Lymphocyte\">lymphocytes<\/a> among the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leucocyte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leucocyte\">leucocytes<\/a> (white blood cells). By studying their granulation he could distinguish between nongranular lymphocytes, mono- and poly-nuclear leucocytes, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Eosinophil_granulocyte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eosinophil granulocyte\">eosinophil granulocytes<\/a>, and mast cells.\n<\/p><p>Starting in 1880, Ehrlich also studied <a href=\"\/wiki\/Red_blood_cell\" title=\"Red blood cell\">red blood cells<\/a>. He demonstrated the existence of nucleated red blood cells, which he <a href=\"\/wiki\/Erythropoiesis\" title=\"Erythropoiesis\">subdivided<\/a> into normoblasts, megaloblasts, microblasts and poikiloblasts; he had discovered the precursors of erythrocytes. Ehrlich thus also laid the basis for the analysis of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anemia\" title=\"Anemia\">anemias<\/a>, after he had created the basis for systematizing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leukemia\" title=\"Leukemia\">leukemias<\/a> with his investigation of white blood cells.\n<\/p><p>His duties at the Charit\u00e9 included analyzing patients' blood and urine specimens. In 1881 he published a new urine test which could be used to distinguish various types of typhoid from simple cases of diarrhea. The intensity of staining made possible a disease prognosis. The pigment solution he used is known today as Ehrlich's reagent.\nEhrlich's great achievement, but also a source of problems during his further career, was that he had initiated a new field of study interrelating chemistry, biology and medicine. Much of his work was rejected by the medical profession, which lacked the requisite chemical knowledge. It also meant that there was no suitable professorship in sight for Ehrlich.\n<\/p><p>When a student in Breslau, Ehrlich was given an opportunity by the pathologist Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to conduct extensive research and was also introduced to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Koch\" title=\"Robert Koch\">Robert Koch<\/a>, who was at the time a district physician in Wollstein, Posen Province. In his spare time, Koch had clarified the life cycle of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anthrax\" title=\"Anthrax\">anthrax<\/a> pathogen and had contacted <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ferdinand_Cohn\" title=\"Ferdinand Cohn\">Ferdinand Cohn<\/a>, who was quickly convinced by Koch's work and introduced him to his Breslau colleagues. From 30 April to 2 May 1876, Koch presented his investigations in Breslau, which the student Paul Ehrlich was able to attend.\n<\/p><p>On 24 March 1882, Ehrlich was present when Robert Koch, working since 1880 at the Imperial Public Health Office (<i>Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt<\/i>) in Berlin, presented the lecture in which he reported how he was able to identify the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis\" title=\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\">tuberculosis pathogen<\/a>. Ehrlich later described this lecture as his \"greatest experience in science\". The day after Koch's lecture, Ehrlich had already made an improvement to Koch's staining method, which Koch unreservedly welcomed. From this date on, the two men were bound in friendship.\n<\/p><p>In 1887 Ehrlich became an unsalaried lecturer in internal medicine (<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Privatdozent\" title=\"Privatdozent\">Privatdozent<\/a> f\u00fcr Innere Medizin<\/i>) at Berlin University, and in 1890 took over the tuberculosis station at a public hospital in Berlin-Moabit at Koch's request. This was where Koch's hoped-for tuberculosis therapeutic agent <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tuberculin\" title=\"Tuberculin\">tuberculin<\/a> was under study; and Ehrlich had even injected himself with it. In the ensuing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tuberculin#The_tuberculin_scandal\" title=\"Tuberculin\">tuberculin scandal<\/a>, Ehrlich tried to support Koch and stressed the value of tuberculin for diagnostic purposes. In 1891 Koch invited Ehrlich to work at the newly founded Institute of Infectious Diseases (<i>Institut f\u00fcr Infektionskrankheiten<\/i> \u2013 now the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Koch_Institute\" title=\"Robert Koch Institute\">Robert Koch Institute<\/a>)<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> at <i>Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t<\/i> (now Humboldt University) in Berlin. Koch was unable to give him any remuneration, but did offer him full access to laboratory staff, patients, chemicals and laboratory animals, which Ehrlich always remembered with gratitude.\n<\/p><p>Ehrlich had started his first experiments on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Immunization\" title=\"Immunization\">immunization<\/a> already in his private laboratory. He accustomed mice to the poisons <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ricin\" title=\"Ricin\">ricin<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Abrin\" title=\"Abrin\">abrin<\/a>. After feeding them with small but increasing dosages of ricin he ascertained that they had become \"ricin-proof\". Ehrlich interpreted this as immunization and observed that it was abruptly initiated after a few days and was still in existence after several months, but mice immunized against ricin were just as sensitive to abrin as untreated animals.\n<\/p><p>This was followed by investigations on the \"inheritance\" of acquired immunity. It was already known that in some cases after a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Smallpox\" title=\"Smallpox\">smallpox<\/a> or syphilis infection, specific immunity was transmitted from the parents to their offspring. Ehrlich rejected inheritance in the genetic sense because the offspring of a male mouse immunized against abrin and an untreated female mouse were not immune to abrin. He concluded that the fetus was supplied with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antibodies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antibodies\">antibodies<\/a> via the pulmonary circulation of the mother. This idea was supported by the fact that this \"inherited immunity\" decreased after a few months. In another experiment he exchanged the offspring of treated and untreated female mice. The mice which were nursed by the treated females were protected from the poison, providing the proof that antibodies can also be conveyed in milk.\n<\/p><p>Ehrlich also researched <a href=\"\/wiki\/Autoimmunity\" title=\"Autoimmunity\">autoimmunity<\/a>, but he specifically rejected the possibility that an organism's immune system could attack the organism's own tissue calling it \"horror autotoxicus\". It was Ehrlich's student, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ernest_Witebsky\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ernest Witebsky\">Ernest Witebsky<\/a>, who demonstrated that autoimmunity could cause disease in humans.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup> Ehrlich was the first to propose that regulatory mechanisms existed to protect an organism from autoimmunity, saying in 1906 that \"the organism possesses certain contrivances by means of which the immunity reaction, so easily produced by all kinds of cells, is prevented from acting against the organism's own elements\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/wiki\/Emil_Behring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emil Behring\">Emil Behring<\/a> had worked at the Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases until 1893 on developing an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antiserum\" title=\"Antiserum\">antiserum<\/a> for treating <a href=\"\/wiki\/Diphtheria\" title=\"Diphtheria\">diphtheria<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tetanus\" title=\"Tetanus\">tetanus<\/a> but with inconsistent results. Koch suggested that Behring and Ehrlich cooperate on the project. This joint work was successful to the extent that Ehrlich was quickly able to increase the level of immunity of the laboratory animals based on his experience with mice. Clinical tests with diphtheria serum early in 1894 were successful and in August the chemical company Hoechst started to market Behring's \"Diphtheria Remedy synthesized by Behring-Ehrlich\". The two discoverers had originally agreed to share any profits after the Hoechst share had been subtracted. Their contract was changed several times and finally Ehrlich was eventually pressured into accepting a profit share of only eight percent. Ehrlich resented what he considered as unfair treatment, and his relationship with Behring was thereafter problematic, a situation which later escalated over the issue of the valency<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup> of tetanus serum. Ehrlich recognized that the principle of serum therapy had been developed by Behring and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kitasato_Shibasabur%C5%8D\" title=\"Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d\">Kitasato<\/a>. But he was of the opinion that he had been the first to develop a serum which could also be used on humans, and that his role in developing the diphtheria serum had been insufficiently acknowledged. Behring, for his part, schemed against Ehrlich at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, and from 1900 on Ehrlich refused to collaborate with him. von Behring was the sole recipient of the first Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1901, for contributions to research on diphtheria.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Since antiserums were an entirely new type of medicine whose quality was highly variable, a government system was established to guarantee their safety and effectiveness. Beginning 1 April 1895, only government-approved serum could be sold in the German Reich. The testing station for diphtheria serum was provisionally housed at the Institute of Infectious Diseases. At the initiative of Friedrich Althoff,<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup> an Institute of Serum Research and Testing (<i>Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung<\/i>) was established in 1896 in Berlin-Steglitz, with Paul Ehrlich as director (which required him to cancel all his contracts with Hoechst). In this function and as honorary professor at Berliner University he had annual earnings of 6,000 marks, approximately the salary of a university professor. In addition to a testing department the institute also had a research department.\n<\/p><p>In order to determine the effectiveness of diphtheria antiserum, a stable concentration of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Diphtheria_toxin\" title=\"Diphtheria toxin\">diphtheria toxin<\/a> was required. Ehrlich discovered that the toxin being used was perishable, in contrast to what had been assumed, which for him led to two consequences: He did not use the toxin as a standard, but instead a serum powder developed by Behring, which had to be dissolved in liquid shortly before use. The strength of a test toxin was first determined in comparison with this standard. The test toxin could then be used as a reference for testing other serums. For the test itself, toxin and serum were mixed in a ratio so that their effects just cancelled each other when injected into a guinea pig. But since there was a large margin in determining whether symptoms of illness were present, Ehrlich established an unambiguous target: the death of the animal. The mixture was to be such that the test animal would die after four days. If it died earlier, the serum was too weak and was rejected. Ehrlich claimed to have made the determination of the valency of serum as accurate as it would be with chemical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Titration\" title=\"Titration\">titration<\/a>. This again demonstrates his tendency to quantify the life sciences.\n<\/p><p>Influenced by the mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Franz Adickes, who endeavored to establish science institutions in Frankfurt in preparation of the founding of a university, Ehrlich's institute moved to Frankfurt in 1899 and was renamed the Royal Prussian Institute of Experimental Therapy (<i>K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfisches Institut f\u00fcr Experimentelle Therapie<\/i>). The German quality-control methodology was copied by government serum institutes all over the world, and they also obtained the standard serum from Frankfurt. After diphtheria antiserum, tetanus serum and various bactericide serums for use in veterinary medicine were developed in rapid sequence. These were also evaluated at the institute, as was <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tuberculin\" title=\"Tuberculin\">tuberculin<\/a> and later on various <a href=\"\/wiki\/Vaccine\" title=\"Vaccine\">vaccines<\/a>. Ehrlich's most important colleague at the institute was the Jewish doctor and biologist Julius Morgenroth.\n<\/p><p>He postulated that cell protoplasm contains special structures which have chemical <i>side chains<\/i> (today's term is <a href=\"\/wiki\/Macromolecule\" title=\"Macromolecule\">macromolecules<\/a>) to which the toxin binds, affecting function. If the organism survives the effects of the toxin, the blocked side-chains are replaced by new ones. This regeneration can be trained, the name for this phenomenon being <i>immunization.<\/i> If the cell produces a surplus of side chains, these might also be released into the blood as antibodies.\n<\/p><p>In the following years Ehrlich expanded his side chain theory using concepts (\"amboceptors\", \"receptors of the first, second and third order\", etc.) which are no longer customary. Between the antigen and the antibody he assumed there was an additional immune molecule, which he called an \"additive\" or a \"complement\". For him, the side chain contained at least two functional groups.\n<\/p><p>For providing a theoretical basis for immunology as well as for his work on serum valency, Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1908 together with <a href=\"\/wiki\/%C3%89lie_Metchnikoff\" title=\"\u00c9lie Metchnikoff\">\u00c9lie Metchnikoff<\/a>. Metchnikoff, who had researched the cellular branch of immunity, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phagocytosis\" title=\"Phagocytosis\">Phagocytosis<\/a>, at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pasteur_Institute\" title=\"Pasteur Institute\">Pasteur Institute<\/a> had previously sharply attacked Ehrlich.\n<\/p><p>In 1901, the Prussian Ministry of Finance criticized Ehrlich for exceeding his budget and as a consequence reduced his income. In this situation Althoff arranged a contact with Georg Speyer, a Jewish philanthropist and joint owner of the bank house Lazard Speyer-Ellissen. The cancerous disease of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Victoria,_Princess_Royal\" title=\"Victoria, Princess Royal\">Princess Victoria<\/a>, the widow of the German Emperor Friedrich II, had received much public attention and prompted a collection among wealthy Frankfurt citizens, including Speyer, in support of cancer research. Ehrlich had also received from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wilhelm II, German Emperor\">the German Emperor Wilhelm II<\/a> a personal request to devote all his energy to cancer research. Such efforts led to the founding of a department for cancer research affiliated with the Institute of Experimental Therapy. The chemist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gustav_Embden\" title=\"Gustav Embden\">Gustav Embden<\/a>, among others, worked there. Ehrlich informed his sponsors that cancer research meant basic research, and that a cure could not be expected soon.\n<\/p><p>Among the results achieved by Ehrlich and his research colleagues was the insight that when tumors are cultivated by transplanting tumor cells, their malignancy increases from generation to generation. If the primary tumor is removed, then <a href=\"\/wiki\/Metastasis\" title=\"Metastasis\">metastasis<\/a> precipitously increases. Ehrlich applied bacteriological methods to cancer research. In analogy to vaccination, he attempted to generate immunity to cancer by injecting weakened cancer cells. Both in cancer research and chemotherapy research (see below) he introduced the methodologies of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Big_Science\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Big Science\">Big Science<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1885 Ehrlich's monograph \"The Need of the Organism for Oxygen\" (<i>Das Sauerstoffbed\u00fcrfnis des Organismus \u2013 Eine farbenanalytische Studie<\/i>) appeared, which he also submitted as a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Habilitation\" title=\"Habilitation\">habilitation<\/a> thesis. In it he introduced the new technology of in vivo staining. One of his findings was that pigments can only be easily assimilated by living organisms if they are in granular form. He injected the dyes <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alizarin\" title=\"Alizarin\">alizarin<\/a> blue and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Indophenol\" title=\"Indophenol\">indophenol<\/a> blue into laboratory animals and established after their death that various organs had been colored to different degrees. In organs with high oxygen saturation, indophenol was retained; in organs with medium saturation, indophenol was reduced, but not alizarin blue. And in areas with low oxygen saturation, both pigments were reduced. With this work, Ehrlich also formulated the conviction which guided his research: that all life processes can be traced to processes of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Physical_chemistry\" title=\"Physical chemistry\">physical chemistry<\/a> occurring in the cell.\n<\/p><p>In the course of his investigations Ehrlich came across <a href=\"\/wiki\/Methylene_blue\" title=\"Methylene blue\">methylene blue<\/a>, which he regarded as particularly suitable for staining bacteria. Later, Robert Koch also used methylene blue as a dye in his research on the tuberculosis pathogen. In Ehrlich's view, an added benefit was that methylene blue also stained the long appendages of nerve cells, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Axon\" title=\"Axon\">axons<\/a>. He initiated a doctoral dissertation on the subject, but did not follow up the topic himself. It was the opinion of the neurologist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ludwig_Edinger\" title=\"Ludwig Edinger\">Ludwig Edinger<\/a> that Ehrlich had thereby opened up a major new topic in the field of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neurology\" title=\"Neurology\">neurology<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>After mid-1889, when Ehrlich was unemployed, he privately continued his research on methylene blue. His work on in vivo staining gave him the idea of using it therapeutically. Since the parasite family of <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Plasmodiidae\" title=\"Plasmodiidae\">Plasmodiidae<\/a><\/i> \u2013 which includes the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Malaria\" title=\"Malaria\">malaria<\/a> pathogen \u2013 can be stained with methylene blue, he thought it could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria. In the case of two patients so treated at the city hospital in Berlin-Moabit, their fever indeed subsided and the malaria plasmodia disappeared from their blood. Ehrlich obtained methylene blue from the company Meister Lucius &amp; Br\u00fcning AG (later renamed Hoechst AG), which started a long collaboration with this company.\n<\/p><p>Before the Institute of Experimental Therapy had moved to Frankfurt, Ehrlich had already resumed work on methylene blue. After the death of Georg Speyer, his widow Franziska Speyer endowed the Georg-Speyer House in his memory<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup> which was erected next door to Ehrlich's institute. As director of the Georg-Speyer House, Ehrlich transferred his chemotherapeutic research there. He was looking for an agent which was as effective as methylene blue, but without its side effects. His model was on the one hand the impact of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quinine\" title=\"Quinine\">quinine<\/a> on malaria, and on the other hand, in analogy to serum therapy, he thought there must also be chemical pharmaceuticals which would have just as specific an effect on individual diseases. His goal was to find a \"Therapia sterilisans magna\", in other words a treatment that could kill all disease pathogens.\n<\/p><p>As a model for experimental therapy Ehrlich used a guinea pig disease <a href=\"\/wiki\/Trypanosoma\" title=\"Trypanosoma\">trypanosoma<\/a> and tested out various chemical substances on laboratory animals. The trypanosomes could indeed be successfully killed with the dye trypan red. Beginning in 1906, he intensively investigated <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arsanilic_acid\" title=\"Arsanilic acid\">atoxyl<\/a> and had it tested by Robert Koch along with other arsenic compounds during Koch's sleeping sickness expedition of 1906\/07. Although the name literally means \"nonpoisonous\", atoxyl does cause damage, especially to the optic nerve. Ehrlich elaborated the systematic testing of chemical compounds in the sense of screening as now practiced in the pharmaceutical industry. He discovered that Compound 418 - Arsenophenylglycine - had an impressive therapeutic effect and had it tested in Africa.\n<\/p><p>With the support of his assistant <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sahachiro_Hata\" title=\"Sahachiro Hata\">Sahachiro Hata<\/a> Ehrlich discovered in 1909 that Compound 606, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arsphenamine\" title=\"Arsphenamine\">Arsphenamine<\/a>, effectively combatted \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Spiral_bacteria\" title=\"Spiral bacteria\">spirillum<\/a>\" <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spirochaete\" title=\"Spirochaete\">spirochaetes<\/a> bacteria, one of whose <a href=\"\/wiki\/Subspecies\" title=\"Subspecies\">subspecies<\/a> causes <a href=\"\/wiki\/Syphilis\" title=\"Syphilis\">syphilis<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]<\/a><\/sup> The compound proved to have few side effects in human trials, and the spirochetes disappeared in seven syphilis patients after this treatment.\n<\/p><p>After extensive clinical testing (all the research participants had the negative example of tuberculin in mind) the Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This was the first agent with a specific therapeutic effect to be created on the basis of theoretical considerations. Salvarsan proved to be amazingly effective, particularly when compared with the conventional therapy of mercury salts. Manufactured by Hoechst AG, Salvarsan became the most widely prescribed drug in the world. It was the most effective drug for treating syphilis until penicillin became available in the 1940s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]<\/a><\/sup> Salvarsan required improvement as to side effects and solubility and was replaced in 1911 with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neosalvarsan\" title=\"Neosalvarsan\">Neosalvarsan<\/a>. Ehrlich's work illuminated the existence of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier#History\" title=\"Blood\u2013brain barrier\">blood-brain barrier<\/a>, although he himself never believed in such a barrier, with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lina_Stern\" title=\"Lina Stern\">Lina Stern<\/a> later coining the phrase.\n<\/p><p>The medication triggered the so-called \"Salvarsan war\". On one side there was hostility on the part of those who feared a resulting moral breakdown of sexual inhibitions. Ehrlich was also accused, with clearly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antisemitism\" title=\"Antisemitism\">anti-Semitic<\/a> undertones, of excessively enriching himself. In addition, Ehrlich's associate, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Paul_Uhlenhuth\" title=\"Paul Uhlenhuth\">Paul Uhlenhuth<\/a> claimed priority in discovering the drug.\n<\/p><p>Because some people died during the clinical testing, Ehrlich was accused of \"stopping at nothing.\" In 1914, one of the most prominent accusers was convicted of criminal libel at a trial for which Ehrlich was called to testify. Though Ehrlich was thereby exonerated, the ordeal threw him into a depression from which he never fully recovered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Ehrlich reasoned that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. Hence, a \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Magic_bullet_(medicine)\" title=\"Magic bullet (medicine)\">magic bullet<\/a>\" (<i>Zauberkugel<\/i>, his term for an ideal therapeutic agent) would be created that killed only the organism targeted. The concept of a \"magic bullet\" has to some extent been realized by the development of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antibody-drug_conjugate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antibody-drug conjugate\">antibody-drug conjugates<\/a> (a monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic biologically active drug), as they enable cytotoxic drugs to be selectively delivered to their designated targets (e.g. cancer cells).\n<\/p><p>In 1910, a street was named after Ehrlich in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen.

While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930. Einstein suggested a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments\" title=\"Einstein's thought experiments\">thought experiment<\/a> in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other.

But because of what would later be called <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_entanglement\" title=\"Quantum entanglement\">quantum entanglement<\/a>, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoward1990_294-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoward1990-294\">[289]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHarriganSpekkens2010_295-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarriganSpekkens2010-295\">[290]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>A more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when Einstein published a paper with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Boris_Podolsky\" title=\"Boris Podolsky\">Boris Podolsky<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nathan_Rosen\" title=\"Nathan Rosen\">Nathan Rosen<\/a> that laid out what would become known as the <a href=\"\/wiki\/EPR_paradox\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EPR paradox\">EPR paradox<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEinsteinPodolskyRosen1935_296-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEinsteinPodolskyRosen1935-296\">[291]<\/a><\/sup> In this thought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other particle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Theory_of_relativity\" title=\"Theory of relativity\">theory of relativity<\/a>. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Probability\" title=\"Probability\">probability<\/a> equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.\" From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers these two observables <a href=\"\/wiki\/Observable#Incompatibility_of_observables_in_quantum_mechanics\" title=\"Observable\">incompatible<\/a> and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system.

In 1929 Fischer succeeded in producing the substance and proving that its ring has a central atom of iron, as he also continued studying other pigmented substances of a biological importance of biochemistry such as chlorophyll, the color that plays part in a plants photosynthesis. Fischer also unraveled the bile pigments biliverdin (which causes the yellowish color characteristic of bruised skin) and bilirubin (which yellows skin in jaundice cases), and synthesized them in 1942 and 1944, successively. He conducted microanalyses of more than 60,000 chemical substance, and had won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1930. The person that sparked Fischer's interest was von Muller, his former professor and supervisor whom interests were in pyrrole pigments by inviting Fischer to work with him at the well-known Second Medical Clinic in Munich in 1910. Under Muller, he began to examine the composition of the bile pigment bilirubin, something he would continue to be engaged in during the decades that followed. Fischer's succession also came with difficulty's as many of his experiments seemed to have failed but with time Fischer was able to perfect his acknowledgement with is failed attempts.\n<\/p><p>Fischer married Wiltrud Haufe around his 50's in the year 1935.

Windaus believed that while every man had a moral code, his science was motivated by curiosity, and was not driven by politics, ethics, and applications of his discoveries. This viewpoint caused Windaus to decline to research poison gas during <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>He was involved in the discovery of the transformation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cholesterol\" title=\"Cholesterol\">cholesterol<\/a> through several steps to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cholecalciferol\" title=\"Cholecalciferol\">vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub><\/a> (Cholecalciferol).

Sterols are nitrogen-free secondary alcohols with high molecular weight that contain alicylic systems, or hydrocarbon rings.  Cholesterol was first discovered in human <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gallstone\" title=\"Gallstone\">gallstones<\/a> and is a mono-unsaturated alcohol found in all higher animals, both as a free alcohol and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fatty_acid_ester\" title=\"Fatty acid ester\">fatty acid ester<\/a>. Windaus was fascinated by how cholesterol levels in the body fluctuate, in particular how it increases during pregnancy and decreases during disease. He researched sterols in insects, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Echinoderm\" title=\"Echinoderm\">echinodermata<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sponge\" title=\"Sponge\">sponges<\/a>, called zoosterols. Many of these zoosterols have the same formula as cholesterol, except for spongosterol, which is a saturated sterol and more different from cholesterol than the other zoosterols. In plants, the sterols are known as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phytosterol\" title=\"Phytosterol\">phytosterols<\/a>. Windaus found that the most common phytosterols are sitosterols, which have the same formula as cholesterol. There are also saturated phytosterols that are mixed in with these unsaturated sitosterols in small quantities. There are also alcohol-like phytosterols, which contain one more <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hydroxy_group\" title=\"Hydroxy group\">hydroxyl group<\/a> than sitosterols and a different number of carbons. Mycosterols are sterols which are found in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fungus\" title=\"Fungus\">fungi<\/a>. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ergosterol\" title=\"Ergosterol\">Ergosterol<\/a> is one significant mycosterol as it has three double bonds, in comparison to the one double bond in cholesterol. In his research, Windaus did not find sterols to exist in bacteria, which he found to be surprising. This research of the composition of sterols, along with their connection to vitamins, earned Windaus the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p><b>Vitamin D2 and D3<\/b>\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/wiki\/Rickets\" title=\"Rickets\">Rickets<\/a>, a bone disease resulting from vitamin D deficiency, was originally treated in the early 1900s through essential dietary factors such as whole milk or cod-liver oil.

Germany could now act as \"the spokesman of the whole German cultural community\" and thereby provoke the German minorities in Czechoslovakia and Poland.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchwarzschild1943168_31-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchwarzschild1943168-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Germany signed the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kellogg-Briand_Pact\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Kellogg-Briand Pact\">Kellogg-Briand Pact<\/a> in August 1928. It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts. Although Stresemann did not propose the pact, Germany's adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with. This new insight was instrumental in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Young_Plan\" title=\"Young Plan\">Young Plan<\/a> of February 1929, which led to more reductions in German reparations payment.\n<\/p><p>Stresemann was not, however, in any sense pro-French. His main preoccupation was to free Germany from the burden of <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I_reparations\" title=\"World War I reparations\">reparations<\/a> payments to France, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. His strategy for this was to forge close economic ties with the United States. The U.S. was Germany's main source of capital and raw materials, and one of Germany's largest export markets for manufactured goods. Germany's economic recovery was thus in the interests of the U.S., and gave the U.S. an incentive to help Germany resolve the reparations burden. The Dawes and Young plans were the result of this strategy. New York bankers loaned large sums to Germany, which used the dollars to pay reparations to France and Britain, which in turn paid their war loans they owed to Washington. Stresemann also hoped to use the United States' new financial involvement in the German economy to incentivize the nation's financial and political institutions to support reform of reparations. This paid off in 1928 when Federal Reserve Chairman <a href=\"\/wiki\/Benjamin_Strong_Jr.\" title=\"Benjamin Strong Jr.\">Benjamin Strong<\/a> supported the development of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Young_Plan\" title=\"Young Plan\">Young Plan<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_11-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup> Stresemann had a close relationship with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Herbert_Hoover\" title=\"Herbert Hoover\">Herbert Hoover<\/a>, who was <a href=\"\/wiki\/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce\" title=\"United States Secretary of Commerce\">Secretary of Commerce<\/a> in 1921-28 and President from 1929.

By the mid-1920s, having contributed much to a (temporary) consolidation of the feeble democratic order, Stresemann was regarded as a <i>Vernunftrepublikaner<\/i> (republican by reason), someone who accepted the republic as the least of all evils but was in his heart still loyal to the monarchy. The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers. Along with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Matthias_Erzberger\" title=\"Matthias Erzberger\">Matthias Erzberger<\/a> and others, he was attacked as a <i>Erf\u00fcllungspolitiker<\/i> (\"fulfillment politician\"). Indeed, some of the more conservative members of his own People's Party never really trusted him.\n<\/p><p>In 1925, when he first proposed an agreement with France, he made it clear that in doing so he intended to \"gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and [...] concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]<\/a><\/sup> In the same year, while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis, Stresemann began a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Trade_war\" title=\"Trade war\">trade war<\/a> against the country.

So Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have \"prematurely\" restabilized the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Economy_of_Poland\" title=\"Economy of Poland\">Polish economy<\/a>. In response to a British proposal, Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London: \"[A] final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong\".

There was one isotope known to have a half life of 6.2 hours, mesothorium II (actinium-228). This was not in any probable decay chain, but it could have been contamination, as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry had experimented with it. Hahn and Meitner demonstrated in 1919 that when actinium is treated with hydrofluoric acid, it remains in the insoluble residue.

The path leading to these results has been reconstructed by MacKinnon,<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">[44]<\/a><\/sup> and the detailed calculations are worked out by Aitchison and coauthors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">[45]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In Copenhagen, Heisenberg and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hans_Kramers\" title=\"Hans Kramers\">Hans Kramers<\/a> collaborated on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering from atoms of radiation whose wavelength is larger than the atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fourier_transform\" title=\"Fourier transform\">Fourier transform<\/a> of the classical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sharp_series\" title=\"Sharp series\">sharp series<\/a> orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Virtual_state\" title=\"Virtual state\">virtual state<\/a> model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper, Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.\n<\/p><p>These two successes, and the continuing failure of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bohr_model\" title=\"Bohr model\">Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld model<\/a> to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anharmonic_oscillator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anharmonic oscillator\">anharmonic oscillator<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>The dipole oscillator consists of a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Simple_harmonic_oscillator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Simple harmonic oscillator\">simple harmonic oscillator<\/a>, which is thought of as a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Charged_particle\" title=\"Charged particle\">charged particle<\/a> on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fourier_series\" title=\"Fourier series\">Fourier series<\/a> in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.\n<\/p><p>He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Perturbation_theory\" title=\"Perturbation theory\">perturbation methods<\/a> that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second-order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme.\n<\/p><p>So Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates with matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr's correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.\n<\/p><p>On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication.

Because of this, his scientific achievements range from the fundamental to the most practical, and his research spans a wide range of topics within the field of chemistry. As a young professor, Ziegler posed the question: what factors contribute to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dissociation_(chemistry)\" title=\"Dissociation (chemistry)\">dissociation<\/a> of carbon-carbon bonds in substituted <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ethane\" title=\"Ethane\">ethane<\/a> derivatives? This question was to lead Ziegler on to a study of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_radicals\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free radicals\">free radicals<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organometallic_chemistry\" title=\"Organometallic chemistry\">organometallics<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Carbon_ring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Carbon ring\">ring compounds<\/a>, and, finally, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polymerization\" title=\"Polymerization\">polymerization processes<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Eisch_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eisch-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>While still a doctoral student at <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Marburg\" title=\"University of Marburg\">University of Marburg<\/a>, Ziegler published his first major article which showed how halochromic (R<sub>3<\/sub>C<sup>+<\/sup>Z<sup>\u2212<\/sup>) salts could be made from carbinols. Previous work had left the impression that halochromic salts or free radicals (R3C\u2022) required R to be <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aromaticity\" title=\"Aromaticity\">aromatic<\/a>. He was encouraged to try to synthesize similarly substituted free radicals, and successfully prepared 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl in 1923 and pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl in 1925. These two compounds were much more stable than previous tri-valent carbon free radicals, such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Triphenylmethyl_radical\" title=\"Triphenylmethyl radical\">triphenylmethyl<\/a>. His interest in the stability of tri-valent carbon free-radical compounds brought him to publish the first of many publications in which he sought to identify the steric and electronic factors responsible for the dissociation of hexa-substituted ethane derivatives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bonnesen_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bonnesen-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Ziegler's work with many-membered ring compounds also utilized the reactive nature of alkali metal compounds. He used strong bases such as the lithium and sodium salts of amines, to accomplish the cyclization of long-chain <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hydrocarbon\" title=\"Hydrocarbon\">hydrocarbons<\/a> possessing terminal cyano groups. The initially formed ring compound was then converted to the desired macrocyclic ketone product. Ziegler's synthetic method, which included running reactions at high dilution to favor the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Intramolecular_reaction\" title=\"Intramolecular reaction\">intramolecular<\/a> cyclization over competing intermolecular reactions, resulted in yields superior to those of existing procedures (Laylin): he was able to prepare large-ringed alicyclic ketones, C<sub>14<\/sub> to C<sub>33<\/sub>, in yields of 60\u201380%.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Eisch_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Eisch-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> An outstanding instance of this synthesis was the preparation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Muscone\" title=\"Muscone\">muscone<\/a>, the odiferous principle of animal musk by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leopold_Ru%C5%BEi%C4%8Dka\" title=\"Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka\">Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Oesper_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Oesper-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup> Ziegler and co-workers published the first of their series of papers on the preparation of large ring systems in 1933.

He discovered that ether scission opened a new method of preparing sodium and potassium alkyls,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Oesper_11-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Oesper-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup> and found that these compounds could easily be converted to the hexa-substituted ethane derivatives. The nature of the substituent could be easily and systematically altered using this synthetic route by simply changing the identity of the ether starting material.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bonnesen_13-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bonnesen-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Later, in 1930, he directly synthesized lithium alkyls and aryls from metallic lithium and halogenated hydrocarbons via <a href=\"\/wiki\/Metal%E2%80%93halogen_exchange\" title=\"Metal\u2013halogen exchange\">metal\u2013halogen exchange<\/a>. This convenient synthesis spurred numerous studies of RLi reagents by others, and now <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organolithium_reagent\" title=\"Organolithium reagent\">organolithium reagents<\/a> are one of the most versatile and valuable tools of the synthetic organic chemist. Ziegler's own research on lithium alkyls and olefins was to lead directly to his discovery of a new polymerization technique some 20 years later.\n<\/p><p>In 1927, he found that when the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alkene\" title=\"Alkene\">olefin<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/(E)-Stilbene\" title=\"(E)-Stilbene\">stilbene<\/a> was added to an ethyl ether solution of phenylisopropyl potassium, an abrupt color change from red to yellow took place. He had just observed the first addition of an organoalkali metal compound across a carbon-carbon double bond. Further work showed that he could successively add more and more of the olefinic hydrocarbon <a href=\"\/wiki\/Butadiene\" title=\"Butadiene\">butadiene<\/a> to a solution of phenylisopropyl potassium and obtain a long-chain hydrocarbon with the reactive organopotassium end still intact. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oligomer\" title=\"Oligomer\">Oligomers<\/a> such as these were the forerunners of the so-called \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Living_polymerization\" title=\"Living polymerization\">living polymers<\/a>\".\n<\/p><p>Since Ziegler was working at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Coal_Research\" title=\"Max Planck Institute for Coal Research\">Max Planck Institute for Coal Research<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ethylene\" title=\"Ethylene\">ethylene<\/a> was readily available as a byproduct from coal gas. Because of this cheap feedstock of ethylene and the relevance to the coal industry, Ziegler began experimenting with ethylene, and made it a goal to synthesize polyethylene of high molecular weight. His attempts were thwarted because a competing elimination reaction kept occurring causing an anomalous result: instead of ethylene being converted into a mixture of higher aluminum alkyls, its dimer, <a href=\"\/wiki\/1-Butene\" title=\"1-Butene\">1-butene<\/a>, was almost the only product. It was reasoned that a contaminant must have been present to cause this unexpected elimination reaction,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bonnesen_13-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bonnesen-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup> and the cause was eventually determined to be traces of nickel salts. Ziegler realized the significance of this finding; if a nickel salt could have such a dramatic influence on the course of an ethylene-aluminum alkyl reaction, then perhaps another metal might delay the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Elimination_reaction\" title=\"Elimination reaction\">elimination reaction<\/a>. Ziegler and his student H. Breil found that salts of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chromium\" title=\"Chromium\">chromium<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Zirconium\" title=\"Zirconium\">zirconium<\/a>, and especially <a href=\"\/wiki\/Titanium\" title=\"Titanium\">titanium<\/a> did not promote the R2AlH-elimination but, instead, enormously accelerated the \"growth\" reaction. Simply passing ethylene, at atmospheric pressure, into a catalytic amount of TiCl3 and Et2AlCl dissolved in a higher alkane led to the prompt deposition of polyethylene. Ziegler was able to obtain <a href=\"\/wiki\/High-density_polyethylene\" title=\"High-density polyethylene\">high molecular weight polyethylene<\/a> (MW &gt; 30,000) and, most importantly, to do so at low ethylene pressures. The Ziegler group suddenly had a polymerization procedure for ethylene superior to all existing processes.\n<\/p><p>In 1952, Ziegler disclosed his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Catalyst\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Catalyst\">catalyst<\/a> to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Montecatini_(company)\" title=\"Montecatini (company)\">Montecatini Company<\/a> in Italy, for which <a href=\"\/wiki\/Giulio_Natta\" title=\"Giulio Natta\">Giulio Natta<\/a> was acting as a consultant. Natta denoted this class of catalysts as \"Ziegler catalysts\" and became extremely interested in their ability and potential to stereoregularly polymerize \u03b1-olefins such as propene.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bonnesen_13-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bonnesen-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup> Ziegler, meanwhile concentrated mainly on the large-scale production of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polyethylene\" title=\"Polyethylene\">polyethylene<\/a> and copolymers of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ethylene\" title=\"Ethylene\">ethylene<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Propylene\" title=\"Propylene\">propylene<\/a>. Soon the scientific community was informed of his discovery. Highly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Crystal\" title=\"Crystal\">crystalline<\/a> and stereoregular polymers that previously could not be prepared became synthetically feasible. For their work on the controlled polymerization of hydrocarbons through the use of these novel organometallic catalysts, Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n<\/p><p>Karl Ziegler received many awards and honors.

No agreements were reached at first but talks continued. In 1970 he signed a treaty with the Soviet Union which normalised relations and recognized existing national boundaries.

Brandt negotiated parallel treaties and agreements with Czechoslovakia.\n<\/p><p>In West Germany, Brandt's <i>Neue Ostpolitik<\/i> was extremely controversial, dividing the populace into two camps. One camp embraced all of the conservative parties, and most notably those West German residents and their families who had been driven west (\"die <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heimatvertriebenen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heimatvertriebenen\">Heimatvertriebenen<\/a>\") by Stalinist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ethnic_cleansing\" title=\"Ethnic cleansing\">ethnic cleansing<\/a> from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Historical_Eastern_Germany\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Historical Eastern Germany\">Historical Eastern Germany<\/a>, especially the part that was given to Poland as a consequence of the end of the war; western <a href=\"\/wiki\/Czechoslovakia\" title=\"Czechoslovakia\">Czechoslovakia<\/a> (the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sudetenland\" title=\"Sudetenland\">Sudetenland<\/a>); and the rest of Eastern Europe, such as in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Romania\" title=\"Romania\">Romania<\/a>. These groups of displaced Germans and their descendants loudly voiced their opposition to Brandt's policy, calling it \"illegal\" and \"high treason\".\nA different camp supported and encouraged Brandt's <i>Neue Ostpolitik<\/i> as aiming at \"change through <a href=\"\/wiki\/Rapprochement\" title=\"Rapprochement\">rapprochement<\/a>\" (<i>Wandel durch Ann\u00e4herung<\/i>), encouraging change through a policy of engagement with the (communist) <a href=\"\/wiki\/Eastern_Bloc\" title=\"Eastern Bloc\">Eastern Bloc<\/a>, rather than trying to isolate these countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt's supporters claim that the policy did help to break down the Eastern Bloc's \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Siege_mentality\" title=\"Siege mentality\">siege mentality<\/a>\" and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of socialism\/communism, which \u2013 together with other events \u2013 eventually led to the downfall of Eastern European communism.\n<\/p><p>Brandt's predecessor as chancellor, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger\" title=\"Kurt Georg Kiesinger\">Kurt Georg Kiesinger<\/a>, had been a member of the Nazi party, and was a more old-fashioned conservative-liberal intellectual. Brandt, having fought the Nazis and having faced down communist Eastern Germany during several crises while he was the mayor of Berlin, became a controversial, but credible, figure in several different factions. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kiesinger's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Grand_coalition\" title=\"Grand coalition\">grand coalition<\/a> cabinet, Brandt helped to gain further international approval for Western Germany, and he laid the foundation stones for his future <i>Neue Ostpolitik<\/i>. There was a wide public-opinion gap between Kiesinger and Brandt in the West German polls.\n<\/p><p>Both men had come to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger considered them to be \"a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them\". On the other hand, Brandt needed a while to get into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Ausserparlamentarische_Opposition\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ausserparlamentarische Opposition\">Ausserparlamentarische Opposition<\/a>\" (APO) (\"the extra-parliamentary opposition\"). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. The unrest led to a renaissance of right-wing parties in some of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bundesland_(Germany)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bundesland (Germany)\">Bundeslands<\/a>' (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.\n<\/p><p>Brandt, however, represented a figure of change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP. In his first speech before the Bundestag as the chancellor, Brandt set forth his political course of reforms ending the speech with his famous words, \"Wir wollen mehr Demokratie wagen\" (literally: \"Let's dare more democracy\", or more figuratively, \"We want to take a chance on more Democracy\"). This speech made Brandt, as well as the Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt's <i>Neue Ostpolitik<\/i> lost him a large part of the German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.\n<\/p><p>Although Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a \"Kanzler der inneren Reformen\" ('Chancellor of domestic reform').<sup id=\"cite_ref-Radice_35-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Radice-35\">[34]<\/a><\/sup> According to the historian <a href=\"\/wiki\/David_Childs\" title=\"David Childs\">David Childs<\/a>, \"Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Childs_36-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Childs-36\">[35]<\/a><\/sup> Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes.

In 1931 Wittig married Waltraud Ernst, a colleague from the Auwers working group. The invitation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karl_Theophil_Fries\" title=\"Karl Theophil Fries\">Karl Fries<\/a> brought him as professor to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/TU_Braunschweig\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"TU Braunschweig\">TU Braunschweig<\/a> in 1932. The time in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Braunschweig\" title=\"Braunschweig\">Braunschweig<\/a> became more and more problematic as the Nazis tried to get rid of Karl Fries and Wittig showed solidarity with him. After the forced retirement of Fries, in 1937 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hermann_Staudinger\" title=\"Hermann Staudinger\">Hermann Staudinger<\/a> offered Wittig a position at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Freiburg\" title=\"University of Freiburg\">University of Freiburg<\/a>, partly because he knew Wittig from his book on stereochemistry in which he supported Staudinger's highly criticized theory of macromolecules. The foundations of carbanion chemistry were laid during Wittig's time in Freiburg.\n<\/p><p>In 1944 he succeeded the head of the organic chemistry department <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wilhelm_Schlenk\" title=\"Wilhelm Schlenk\">Wilhelm Schlenk<\/a> at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_T%C3%BCbingen\" title=\"University of T\u00fcbingen\">University of T\u00fcbingen<\/a>. Most of his scientific work, including the development of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wittig_reaction\" title=\"Wittig reaction\">Wittig reaction<\/a>, was performed during this time in T\u00fcbingen. The 1956 appointment of the nearly sixty-year-old Wittig as head of the organic chemistry department at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Heidelberg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Heidelberg\">University of Heidelberg<\/a> as successor of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karl_Freudenberg\" title=\"Karl Freudenberg\">Karl Freudenberg<\/a> was exceptional even at that time. The newly built department and the close connection to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/BASF\" title=\"BASF\">BASF<\/a> convinced Wittig to take this opportunity. He worked at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Heidelberg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Heidelberg\">University of Heidelberg<\/a> even after his retirement in 1967 and published papers until 1980. Most of his awards were presented during this time at Heidelberg, such as the honorary doctorate of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Paris\" title=\"University of Paris\">Sorbonne<\/a> in 1956 and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Chemistry\">Nobel Prize in Chemistry<\/a> in 1979.\n<\/p><p>Wittig's contributions also include the preparation of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phenyllithium\" title=\"Phenyllithium\">phenyllithium<\/a> and the discovery of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/1,2-Wittig_rearrangement\" title=\"1,2-Wittig rearrangement\">1,2-Wittig rearrangement<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/2,3-Wittig_rearrangement\" title=\"2,3-Wittig rearrangement\">2,3-Wittig rearrangement<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Wittig was well known in the chemistry community for being a consummate experimenter and observer of chemical transformations, while caring very little for the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Theoretical\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Theoretical\">theoretical<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mechanistic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mechanistic\">mechanistic<\/a> underpinnings of the work he produced.\n<\/p><p>Georg also has his name on a literature work titled on a compound labelled <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Colopidalol&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Colopidalol (page does not exist)\">Colopidalol<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-WittigMangold1948_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WittigMangold1948-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/c7fcb254c5b964d4881a944716de6ba953e4d7fb.jpg"},{"link":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ernst_Otto_Fischer","name":"Ernst Otto Fischer","year":1973,"category":"Chemistry","country":"Germany","text":"Ernst Otto Fischer , Chemistry, 1973","date_of_birth":"1918-11-10T00:00:00.000","date_of_death":"2007-07-23T00:00:00.000","place_of_birth":"Solln","place_of_death":"Munich","gender":"male","award_age":55,"born_in":null,"mini_bio":"<p><b>Ernst Otto Fischer<\/b> (<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1177148991\">.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}<\/style><span class=\"IPA-label IPA-label-small\">German pronunciation:<\/span> <span class=\"IPA nowrap\" lang=\"de-Latn-fonipa\"><a href=\"\/wiki\/Help:IPA\/Standard_German\" title=\"Help:IPA\/Standard German\">[\u02c8\u025b\u0281nst<span class=\"wrap\"> <\/span>\u02cc\u0254to<span class=\"wrap\"> <\/span>\u02c8f\u026a\u0283\u0250]<\/a><\/span> <span class=\"noprint\"><span class=\"ext-phonos skin-invert\"><span data-nosnippet=\"\" id=\"ooui-php-1\" class=\"ext-phonos-PhonosButton noexcerpt ext-phonos-PhonosButton-emptylabel oo-ui-widget oo-ui-widget-enabled oo-ui-buttonElement oo-ui-buttonElement-frameless oo-ui-iconElement oo-ui-buttonWidget\" data-ooui='{\"_\":\"mw.Phonos.PhonosButton\",\"href\":\"\\\/\\\/upload.wikimedia.org\\\/wikipedia\\\/commons\\\/transcoded\\\/1\\\/10\\\/De-Ernst_Otto_Fischer.ogg\\\/De-Ernst_Otto_Fischer.ogg.mp3\",\"rel\":[\"nofollow\"],\"framed\":false,\"icon\":\"volumeUp\",\"data\":{\"ipa\":\"\",\"text\":\"\",\"lang\":\"en\",\"wikibase\":\"\",\"file\":\"De-Ernst Otto Fischer.ogg\"},\"classes\":[\"ext-phonos-PhonosButton\",\"noexcerpt\",\"ext-phonos-PhonosButton-emptylabel\"]}'><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/transcoded\/1\/10\/De-Ernst_Otto_Fischer.ogg\/De-Ernst_Otto_Fischer.ogg.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\" aria-label=\"Play audio\" title=\"Play audio\" class=\"oo-ui-buttonElement-button\"><span class=\"oo-ui-iconElement-icon oo-ui-icon-volumeUp\"><\/span><span class=\"oo-ui-labelElement-label\"><\/span><span class=\"oo-ui-indicatorElement-indicator oo-ui-indicatorElement-noIndicator\"><\/span><\/a><\/span><sup class=\"ext-phonos-attribution noexcerpt navigation-not-searchable\"><a href=\"\/wiki\/File:De-Ernst_Otto_Fischer.ogg\" title=\"File:De-Ernst Otto Fischer.ogg\">\u24d8<\/a><\/sup><\/span><\/span>; 10 November 1918 \u2013 23 July 2007) was a German chemist who won the Nobel Prize for pioneering work in the area of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organometallic_chemistry\" title=\"Organometallic chemistry\">organometallic chemistry<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>He was born in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Solln\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Solln\">Solln<\/a>, a borough of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Munich\" title=\"Munich\">Munich<\/a>.

If the bees see the colored card as a shade of gray, then they will confuse the blue card with at least one of the gray-toned cards; bees arriving to feed will visit more than one card in the array. On the other hand, if they have color vision, then the bees visit only the blue card, as it is visually distinct from the other cards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Backhaus_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Backhaus-11\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> A bee's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Color_vision\" title=\"Color vision\">color perception<\/a> is comparable to that of humans, but with a shift away from the red toward the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ultraviolet\" title=\"Ultraviolet\">ultraviolet<\/a> part of the spectrum. For that reason bees cannot distinguish red from black (colorless), but they can distinguish the colors white, yellow, blue and violet. Color pigments which reflect UV radiation expand the spectrum of colors which can be differentiated. For example, several blossoms which may appear to humans to be of the same yellow color will appear to bees as having different colors (multicolored patterns) because of their different proportions of ultraviolet.\n<\/p><p>Frisch's investigation of a bee's powers of orientation were significant. He discovered that bees can recognize the desired compass direction in three different ways: by the Sun, by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polarization_(waves)\" title=\"Polarization (waves)\">polarization<\/a> pattern of the blue sky, and by the Earth's magnetic field, whereby the Sun is used as the main compass, with the alternatives reserved for the conditions arising under cloudy skies or within a dark <a href=\"\/wiki\/Beehive\" title=\"Beehive\">beehive<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Light scattered in a blue sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which is dependent on the position of the Sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.\n<\/p><p>Frisch proved that variations in the position of the Sun over the course of a day provided bees with an orientation tool. They use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the Sun. This makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance, without having to make a comparison with the Sun during long dance phases. This provides them not only with alternative directional information, but also with additional temporal information.\n<\/p><p>Bees have an internal clock with three different synchronization or timekeeping mechanisms. If a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion, it can also find the same location, as well as the precise time at which this source provides food, in the afternoon, based on the position of the sun.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[12]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Based on the magnetic field, the alignment of the plane of a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Honeycomb\" title=\"Honeycomb\">honeycomb<\/a> under construction (e.g., the new honeycomb of a swarm) will be the same as that of the home hive of the swarm, according to Frisch. By experiment, even deformed combs bent into a circle can be produced.\n<\/p><p>The vertical alignment of the honeycomb is attributed by Frisch to the ability of bees to identify what is vertical with the help of their head used as a pendulum together with a ring of sensory cells in the neck.\n<\/p><p>Knowledge about feeding places can be relayed from bee to bee. The means of communication is a special dance of which there are two forms:\n<\/p><p>The \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Round_dance_(honey_bee)\" title=\"Round dance (honey bee)\">round dance<\/a>\" provides the information that there is a feeding place in the vicinity of the beehive at a distance between 50 and 100 meters, without the particular direction being given. By means of close contact among the bees it also supplies information about the type of food (blossom scent).\n<\/p><p>The \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Waggle_dance\" title=\"Waggle dance\">waggle dance<\/a>\" is used to relay information about more distant food sources. In order to do this, the dancing bee moves forward a certain distance on the vertically hanging honeycomb in the hive, then traces a half circle to return to her starting point, whereupon the dance begins again. On the straight stretch, the bee \"waggles\" with her posterior. The direction of the straight stretch contains the information about the direction of the food source, the angle between the straight stretch and the vertical being precisely the angle which the direction of flight has to the position of the sun. The distance to the food source is relayed by the time taken to traverse the straight stretch, one second indicating a distance of approximately one kilometer (so the speed of the dance is inversely related to the actual distance). The other bees take in the information by keeping in close contact with the dancing bee and reconstructing its movements. They also receive information via their sense of smell about what is to be found at the food source (type of food, pollen, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Propolis\" title=\"Propolis\">propolis<\/a>, water) as well as its specific characteristics. The orientation functions so well that the bees can find a food source with the help of the waggle dance even if there are hindrances they must detour around like an intervening mountain.\n<\/p><p>As to a sense of hearing, Frisch could not identify this perceptive faculty, but it was assumed that vibrations could be sensed and used for communication during the waggle dance. Confirmation was later provided by Dr. J\u00fcrgen Tautz, a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Apiology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Apiology\">bee researcher<\/a> at W\u00fcrzburg University's Biocenter.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[14]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The linguistic findings described above were based on Frisch's work primarily with the Carnica variety of bees.

Wieman\">Carl E. Wieman<\/a>, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001.\n<\/p><p>In 1970 he invented a new type of laser that generated light pulses with an extremely high <a href=\"\/wiki\/Electromagnetic_spectrum\" title=\"Electromagnetic spectrum\">spectral<\/a> resolution (i.e. all the photons emitted from the laser had nearly the same energy, to a precision of 1 part in a million). Using this device he succeeded to measure the transition frequency of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Balmer_line\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Balmer line\">Balmer line<\/a> of atomic <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hydrogen\" title=\"Hydrogen\">hydrogen<\/a> with a much higher precision than before. During the late 1990s, he and his coworkers developed a new method to measure the frequency of laser light to an even higher precision, using a device called the optical frequency <a href=\"\/wiki\/Comb_generator\" title=\"Comb generator\">comb generator<\/a>. This invention was then used to measure the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lyman_series\" title=\"Lyman series\">Lyman<\/a> line of atomic hydrogen to an extraordinary precision of 1 part in a hundred trillion. At such a high precision, it became possible to search for possible changes in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dimensionless_physical_constant\" title=\"Dimensionless physical constant\">fundamental physical constants<\/a> of the universe over time. For these achievements he became co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2005.\n<\/p><p>The Nobel Prize was awarded to Professor H\u00e4nsch in recognition for work that he did at the end of the 1990s at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, near Munich, Germany. He developed an optical \"frequency comb synthesiser\", which makes it possible, for the first time, to measure with extreme precision the number of light oscillations per second. These optical frequency measurements can be millions of times more precise than previous spectroscopic determinations of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wavelength\" title=\"Wavelength\">wavelength<\/a> of light.\n<\/p><p>The work in Garching was motivated by experiments on the very precise laser spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom. This atom has a particularly simple structure. By precisely determining its spectral line, scientists were able to draw conclusions about how valid our fundamental physical constants are \u2013 if, for example, they change slowly with time. By the end of the 1980s, the laser spectroscopy of hydrogen had reached the maximum precision allowed by interferometric measurements of optical wavelengths.\n<\/p><p>The researchers at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Max_Planck_Institute_of_Quantum_Optics\" title=\"Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics\">Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics<\/a> thus speculated about new methods, and developed the optical frequency comb synthesizer. Its name comes from the fact that it generates a light spectrum out of what are originally single-colour, ultrashort pulses of light. This spectrum is made of hundreds of thousands of sharp spectral lines with a constant frequency interval.\n<\/p><p>Such a frequency comb is similar to a ruler. When the frequency of a particular radiation is determined, it can be compared to the extremely acute comb spectral lines, until one is found that \"fits\". In 1998, Professor H\u00e4nsch received a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Altria_Group\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Altria Group\">Philip Morris<\/a> Research Prize for the development of this \"measurement device\".\n<\/p><p>One of the first applications of this new kind of light source was to determine the frequency of the very narrow ultraviolet hydrogen 1S-2S two-photon transition. Since then, the frequency has been determined with a precision of 15 decimal places.\n<\/p><p>The frequency comb now serves as the basis for optical frequency measurements in large numbers of laboratories worldwide. Since 2002, the company Menlo Systems, in whose foundation the Max Planck Institute in Garching played a role, has been delivering commercial frequency comb synthesizers to laboratories all over the world.\n<\/p><p>H\u00e4nsch introduced intracavity telescopic beam expansion to grating tuned laser oscillators<sup id=\"cite_ref-H\u00e4nsch_p=895_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-H%C3%A4nsch_p=895-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> thus producing the first narrow-linewidth tunable laser.
