They argued bitterly over Banting's demands to Macleod, which included a salary for himself and Best, a private room to work in, an assistant to take care of the dogs, and repairs for the operating room. Macleod initially declined on the grounds that this would cause other research in the department to suffer, to which Banting remarked that he would take the research elsewhere if the University of Toronto did not see any value in it. Macleod relented, and for a while their relations improved. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings.

Additionally, when the <a href=\"\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" title=\"United States Department of Defense\">United States Department of Defense<\/a> leaked documents detailing the proposed missile defences, the Tories claimed a Liberal government would let Canada be a decoy in the event of a nuclear exchange with the Soviets.\n<\/p><p>By election day, the Liberals had recovered their momentum and took 129 seats to the Tories' 95. The Liberals won 41 percent of the vote, normally enough for a majority. However, their gains were heavily concentrated in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic; they only won three seats on the Prairies, leaving them five short of a majority. After six Social Credit MPs from Quebec announced their support for the Liberals,<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">[28]<\/a><\/sup> Pearson was able to guarantee stable government to the Governor-General. Rather than face certain defeat in the Commons, Diefenbaker resigned, allowing Pearson to form a minority government. He was sworn in as prime minister on 22 April 1963.<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">[29]<\/a><\/sup> While the <i>cr\u00e9ditistes<\/i> repudiated this statement days later, Pearson was able to stay in office with the support of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/New_Democratic_Party\" title=\"New Democratic Party\">New Democratic Party<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Pearson campaigned during the 1963 election promising \"60 Days of Decision\" and supported the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bomarc\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bomarc\">Bomarc<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Surface-to-air_missile\" title=\"Surface-to-air missile\">surface-to-air missile<\/a> program. Pearson never had a majority in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/House_of_Commons_of_Canada\" title=\"House of Commons of Canada\">House of Commons<\/a>, but he brought in many of Canada's major updated social programs, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Medicare_(Canada)\" title=\"Medicare (Canada)\">universal health care<\/a> (though that credit should be shared with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tommy_Douglas\" title=\"Tommy Douglas\">Tommy Douglas<\/a>, who as premier of Saskatchewan had introduced the country's first medicare system), the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Canada_Pension_Plan\" title=\"Canada Pension Plan\">Canada Pension Plan<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Canada_Student_Loans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Canada Student Loans\">Canada Student Loans<\/a>.

Ultimately, the Liberals were only able to pick up three more seats, leaving them two short of a majority. As in 1963, the Liberals were almost nonexistent in the Prairies, winning only one seat there.\n<\/p><p>Pearson also started a number of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_commission\" title=\"Royal commission\">royal commissions<\/a>, including the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women\" title=\"Royal Commission on the Status of Women\">Royal Commission on the Status of Women<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Royal_Commission_on_Bilingualism_and_Biculturalism\" title=\"Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism\">Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism<\/a>.

After Pearson's term in office, French was made an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Official_language\" title=\"Official language\">official language<\/a>, and the Canadian government provided services in both English and French. Pearson himself had hoped that he would be the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada and fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for candidates for Prime Minister after Pearson left office.\n<\/p><p>In 1967, Pearson's government introduced a discrimination-free <a href=\"\/wiki\/Points-based_immigration_system\" title=\"Points-based immigration system\">points-based system<\/a> which encouraged immigration to Canada, making it the first country in the world to do so.\n<\/p><p>Pearson oversaw <a href=\"\/wiki\/Canadian_Centennial\" title=\"Canadian Centennial\">Canada's centennial celebrations<\/a> in 1967 before retiring.

Much of Card's work centers on a comparison between the United States and Canada in various situations. On immigration, Card's research has shown that the economic impact of new immigrants is minimal. Card has done several case studies on the rapid assimilation of immigrant groups, finding that they have little or no impact on wages. For example, Card studied the economic impacts of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mariel_boatlift\" title=\"Mariel boatlift\">Mariel boatlift<\/a>, and compared the economic effects in Miami to those in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and Tampa, which receive fewer Cuban immigrants.<sup id=\"cite_ref-NYT06_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NYT06-8\">[8]<\/a><\/sup> Card found that despite the drastic increase in low-skilled labor in Miami by 7%, wages for the low-skilled workers were not significantly affected.

These models would not make the same unambiguous predictions and would allow for consideration of other wage setting factors, thus allowing for a more complete encasement of the low-wage market. Card describes two key implications of the work, policy and economic research implications. The first described implication of the work describes that there is too great of an emphasis placed on minimum wage policy, with those in opposition exaggerating the influence on employment and those in favor overemphasizing the effects on poverty. The focus of the policy debate, according to Card, should be the distributional effects of minimum wage, how minimum wage influences wage inequality, which the findings present suggest that it will counteract the growth experienced in the 1980s.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">[28]<\/a><\/sup> Finally, Card believes that this work will greatly influence economic research in two manners, establishing prespecified conditions and the importance of firm-level microdata. Prespecified conditions will allow for broad agreement amongst researchers in regard to methodology, he believed that this work would allow for acceptance of this standard in economics. The value of firm-level microdata which would allow for a deeper understanding of factors that determine wages and alter the analysis of a variety of topics allowing for greater precision in data sets.

Since the late 1960s, experiments have hinted that neutrinos may have mass. Theoretical models of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sun\" title=\"Sun\">Sun<\/a> predict that neutrinos should be made in large numbers. Neutrino detectors on the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Earth\" title=\"Earth\">Earth<\/a> have repeatedly seen fewer than the expected number of neutrinos. Because neutrinos come in three varieties (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos), and because solar neutrino detectors have been primarily sensitive only to electron neutrinos, the preferred explanation over the years is that those \"missing\" neutrinos had changed, or oscillated, into a variety for which the detectors had little or no sensitivity. If a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neutrino_oscillation\" title=\"Neutrino oscillation\">neutrino oscillates<\/a>, according to the laws of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_mechanics\" title=\"Quantum mechanics\">quantum mechanics<\/a>, then it must have a mass.<sup id=\"cite_ref-sno_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-sno-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1984, McDonald's collaborator <a href=\"\/wiki\/Herb_Chen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Herb Chen\">Herb Chen<\/a> at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_California_at_Irvine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of California at Irvine\">University of California at Irvine<\/a> suggested the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup> Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other sensitive to only the electron neutrino.  Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly.  Chen, Professor George Ewan, Professor David Sinclair, McDonald, and 12 other scientists formed the original <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory\" title=\"Sudbury Neutrino Observatory\">Sudbury Neutrino Observatory<\/a> (SNO) collaboration to exploit this idea in 1984.<sup id=\"cite_ref-nobelprizeII_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobelprizeII-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>  SNO was to be a detector facility using 1000 tonnes of heavy water located 6,800 feet (2,100\u00a0m) underground in a mine outside Sudbury, Ontario.
