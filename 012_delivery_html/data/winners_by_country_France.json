He was the first winner of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/1901_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature\" title=\"1901 Nobel Prize in Literature\">Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Parnassianism\" title=\"Parnassianism\">Parnassus school<\/a>, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n<\/p><p>Prudhomme's parents were M. Sully Prudhomme and Clotilde Caillat.  They had been engaged for 10 years before they had felt financially able to marry. When Prudhomme was two, his father, a shopkeeper, died.  His mother and he relocated to Prudhomme's uncle's house. Prudhomme joined his father's name \"Sully\" with his surname Prudhomme, becoming Sully-Prudhomme. He was interested in classic literature and mathematics in school. He also considered entering the Dominican order, but decided against it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Prudhomme attended the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lyc%C3%A9e_Condorcet\" title=\"Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet\">Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte<\/a>, but eye trouble interrupted his studies.

The favourable reception of his early poems by the <i>Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re<\/i> (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n<\/p><p>His first collection, <i>Stances et Po\u00e8mes<\/i> (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sainte-Beuve\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sainte-Beuve\">Sainte-Beuve<\/a>. It included his most famous poem, <i>Le vase bris\u00e9<\/i>. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Franco-Prussian_War\" title=\"Franco-Prussian War\">Franco-Prussian War<\/a>. This war, which he discussed in <i>Impressions de la guerre<\/i> (1872) and <i>La France<\/i> (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n<\/p><p>During his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Parnassianism\" title=\"Parnassianism\">Parnassus<\/a> school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lucretius\" title=\"Lucretius\">Lucretius<\/a>'s <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/De_rerum_natura\" title=\"De rerum natura\">De rerum natura<\/a><\/i>, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in <i>La Justice<\/i> (1878) and <i>Le Bonheur<\/i> (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\">Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise<\/a> in 1881.

He published two important essays: <i>L'Expression dans les beaux-arts<\/i> (1884) and <i>R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers<\/i> (1892), a series of articles on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blaise_Pascal\" title=\"Blaise Pascal\">Blaise Pascal<\/a> in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/La_Revue_des_Deux_Mondes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"La Revue des Deux Mondes\">La Revue des Deux Mondes<\/a><\/i> (1890), and an article on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_will\" title=\"Free will\">free will<\/a> (<i>La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre<\/i>, 1906) in the <i>Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>The first writer to receive the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_for_Literature\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobel Prize for Literature\">Nobel Prize for Literature<\/a> (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lofty_idealism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lofty idealism\">lofty idealism<\/a>, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_gens_de_lettres\" title=\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres\">Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres<\/a><\/i>.

In 1859, while on his way to petition <a href=\"\/wiki\/Napoleon_III\" title=\"Napoleon III\">Napoleon III<\/a>, he witnessed the aftermath of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Battle_of_Solferino\" title=\"Battle of Solferino\">Battle of Solferino<\/a> in northern Italy. Horrified by the suffering of the wounded and the lack of care they received, Dunant took the initiative to organize the local population in providing aid for the soldiers. After returning to Geneva, he recorded his experiences in the book <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/A_Memory_of_Solferino\" title=\"A Memory of Solferino\">A Memory of Solferino<\/a><\/i>, in which he advocated the formation of an organization that would provide relief for the wounded without discrimination in times of war. In February 1863, Dunant was a member of a five-person committee that sought to put his plan into action, which in effect founded the organization that would become the <a href=\"\/wiki\/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross\" title=\"International Committee of the Red Cross\">International Committee of the Red Cross<\/a>. A year later, he took part in a diplomatic conference organized by the Swiss government that led to the signing of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/First_Geneva_Convention\" title=\"First Geneva Convention\">First Geneva Convention<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Dunant became embroiled in a business scandal in 1867 which resulted in his bankruptcy and expulsion from the International Committee. He spent the next decades in poverty and obscurity, living in various places across Europe before settling in the Swiss village of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heiden,_Switzerland\" title=\"Heiden, Switzerland\">Heiden<\/a>. In 1895, Dunant was rediscovered by a journalist, which brought him renewed attention and support, and in 1901 he was awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize alongside French pacifist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Passy\" title=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy<\/a>. He died in Heiden in 1910.\n<\/p><p>Dunant was born in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Geneva\" title=\"Geneva\">Geneva<\/a>, Switzerland, in 1828 as the first son of businessman Jean-Jacques Dunant and Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. His family was devoutly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Calvinism\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Calvinism\">Calvinist<\/a> and had significant influence in Geneva society. His parents stressed the value of social work, and his father was active helping orphans and parolees, while his mother worked with the sick and the poor.\n<\/p><p>Dunant grew up during the period of religious awakening known as the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/R%C3%A9veil\" title=\"R\u00e9veil\">R\u00e9veil<\/a><\/i>, and at age 18 he joined the Geneva Society for Alms giving. In the following year, together with friends, he founded the so-called \"Thursday Association\", a loose band of young men that met to study the Bible and help the poor, and he spent much of his free time engaged in prison visits and social work. On 30 November 1852, he founded the Geneva chapter of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/YMCA\" title=\"YMCA\">YMCA<\/a> and three years later he took part in the Paris meeting devoted to the founding of its international organization.\n<\/p><p>In 1849, at age 21, Dunant left the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Coll%C3%A8ge_Calvin\" title=\"Coll\u00e8ge Calvin\">Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve<\/a> due to poor grades and began an apprenticeship with the money-changing firm <i>Lullin et Sautter<\/i>. After its successful conclusion, he stayed as an employee of the bank.\n<\/p><p>In 1853, Dunant visited <a href=\"\/wiki\/Algeria\" title=\"Algeria\">Algeria<\/a>, Tunisia, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sicily\" title=\"Sicily\">Sicily<\/a>, on assignment with a company devoted to the \"colonies of Setif\" (<i>Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de S\u00e9tif<\/i>). Despite little experience, he successfully fulfilled the assignment. Inspired by the trip, he wrote his first book with the title <i>An Account of the Regency in Tunis<\/i> (<i>Notice sur la R\u00e9gence de Tunis<\/i>), published in 1858.\n<\/p><p>In 1856, he created a business to operate in foreign colonies, and, after being granted a land concession by French-occupied Algeria, a corn-growing and trading company called the Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-Dj\u00e9mila Mills (<i>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Dj\u00e9mila<\/i>). However, the land and water rights were not clearly assigned, and the colonial authorities were not especially cooperative. As a result, in 1859 Dunant decided to appeal directly to French emperor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Napol%C3%A9on_III\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Napol\u00e9on III\">Napol\u00e9on III<\/a>, who was with his army in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lombardy\" title=\"Lombardy\">Lombardy<\/a> at the time. France was fighting on the side of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kingdom_of_Sardinia\" title=\"Kingdom of Sardinia\">Piedmont-Sardinia<\/a> against <a href=\"\/wiki\/Austrian_Empire\" title=\"Austrian Empire\">Austria<\/a> in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_Italian_War_of_Independence\" title=\"Second Italian War of Independence\">Austro-Sardinian War<\/a>. Napoleon's headquarters were located in the small city of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Solferino\" title=\"Solferino\">Solferino<\/a>. Dunant wrote a flattering book full of praise for Napoleon III with the intention to present it to the emperor, and then traveled to Solferino to meet with him personally.\n<\/p><p>Dunant arrived in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Solferino\" title=\"Solferino\">Solferino<\/a> on the evening of 24 June 1859, on the same day a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Battle_of_Solferino\" title=\"Battle of Solferino\">battle<\/a> between the two sides had occurred nearby. Forty thousand wounded, dying and dead remained on the battlefield, and there appeared to be little attempt to provide care. Shocked, Dunant himself took the initiative to organize the civilian population, especially the women and girls, to provide assistance to the injured and sick soldiers. They lacked sufficient materials and supplies, and Dunant himself organized the purchase of needed materials and helped erect makeshift hospitals. He convinced the population to service the wounded without regard to their side in the conflict as per the slogan \"<i>Tutti fratelli<\/i>\" (All are brothers) coined by the women of nearby city <a href=\"\/wiki\/Castiglione_delle_Stiviere\" title=\"Castiglione delle Stiviere\">Castiglione delle Stiviere<\/a>. He also succeeded in gaining the release of Austrian doctors captured by the French and British.\n<\/p><p>After returning to Geneva early in July, Dunant decided to write a book about his experiences, which he titled <i>Un Souvenir de Solferino<\/i> (<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/A_Memory_of_Solferino\" title=\"A Memory of Solferino\">A Memory of Solferino<\/a><\/i>). It was published in 1862 in an edition of 1,600 copies and was printed at Dunant's own expense. In the book, he described the battle, its costs, and the chaotic circumstances afterwards. He also developed the idea that in the future a neutral organization should exist to provide care to wounded soldiers. He distributed the book to many leading political and military figures in Europe.\n<\/p><p>\nDunant also began to travel through Europe to promote his ideas. His book was largely positively received, and the President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, jurist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gustave_Moynier\" title=\"Gustave Moynier\">Gustave Moynier<\/a>, made the book and its suggestions the topic of the 9 February 1863 meeting of the organization. Dunant's recommendations were examined and positively assessed by the members. They created a five-person Committee to further pursue the possibility of their implementation and made Dunant one of the members. The others were Moynier, the Swiss army general <a href=\"\/wiki\/Henri_Dufour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Henri Dufour\">Henri Dufour<\/a>, and doctors <a href=\"\/wiki\/Louis_Appia\" title=\"Louis Appia\">Louis Appia<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Th%C3%A9odore_Maunoir\" title=\"Th\u00e9odore Maunoir\">Th\u00e9odore Maunoir<\/a>. Their first meeting on 17 February 1863 is now considered the founding date of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross\" title=\"International Committee of the Red Cross\">International Committee of the Red Cross<\/a>.<\/p><p>From early on, Moynier and Dunant had increasing disagreements and conflicts regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant's idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to insist upon this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking political and military figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the idealist among the five.\n<\/p><p>In October 1863, 14 states took part in a meeting in Geneva organized by the committee to discuss the improvement of care for wounded soldiers. Dunant was a protocol leader during the meeting. A year later on 22 August 1864, a diplomatic conference organized by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)\" title=\"Federal Council (Switzerland)\">Swiss government<\/a> led to the signing of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/First_Geneva_Convention\" title=\"First Geneva Convention\">First Geneva Convention<\/a> by 12 states. Dunant was in charge of organizing accommodation for the attendees.\n<\/p><p>Dunant's businesses in Algeria had suffered. In April 1867, the bankruptcy of the financial firm <i>Cr\u00e9dit Genevois<\/i> led to a scandal involving Dunant. He declared bankruptcy. The social outcry in Geneva, a city deeply rooted in Calvinist traditions, also led to calls for him to separate himself from the International Committee. Already on 25 August 1867, he resigned as Secretary and, on 8 September 1867, he was fully removed from the committee. Dunant was condemned by the Geneva Trade Court on 17 August 1868 for deceptive practices in the bankruptcies. Due to their investments in the firm, his family and many of his friends were also heavily affected by the downfall of the company.\n<\/p><p>In February 1868, Dunant's mother died. Later that year he was expelled from the YMCA because he was the Geneva founder of it and they felt his business failure tainted the group. In March 1867, he left his home city Geneva and would not return for the rest of his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of <i>Sciences Morales<\/i> at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Exposition_Universelle_(1867)\" title=\"Exposition Universelle (1867)\">Paris World's Fair<\/a> did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the committee as a whole. Napol\u00e9on III's offer to take over half of Dunant's debts if Dunant's friends would secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier's efforts.\n<\/p><p>Dunant moved to Paris, where he lived in meagre conditions. However, he continued to pursue his humanitarian ideas and plans. During the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Franco-Prussian_War\" title=\"Franco-Prussian War\">Franco-Prussian War<\/a> (1870\u20131871), he founded the Common Relief Society (<i>Allgemeine F\u00fcrsorgegesellschaft<\/i>) and soon after the Common Alliance for Order and Civilisation (<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Allgemeine_Allianz_f%C3%BCr_Ordnung_und_Zivilisation\" title=\"Allgemeine Allianz f\u00fcr Ordnung und Zivilisation\">Allgemeine Allianz f\u00fcr Ordnung und Zivilisation<\/a><\/i>). He argued for disarmament negotiations and for the erection of an international court to mediate international conflicts. Later he worked for the creation of a world library, an idea which had echoes in future projects such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/UNESCO\" title=\"UNESCO\">UNESCO<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In his continued pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Debt\" title=\"Debt\">debt<\/a> and being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Prussia\" title=\"Prussia\">Prussia<\/a> and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stuttgart\" title=\"Stuttgart\">Stuttgart<\/a>, Rome, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Corfu\" title=\"Corfu\">Corfu<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Basel\" title=\"Basel\">Basel<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karlsruhe\" title=\"Karlsruhe\">Karlsruhe<\/a>. In Stuttgart he met the <a href=\"\/wiki\/T%C3%BCbingen_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"T\u00fcbingen University\">T\u00fcbingen University<\/a> student Rudolf M\u00fcller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heiden_AR\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Heiden AR\">Heiden<\/a> for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent the rest of his life there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.\n<\/p><p>In Heiden, he met the young teacher Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife Susanna; they encouraged him to record his life experiences. Sonderegger's wife founded a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden and in 1890 Dunant became its honorary president. With Sonderegger, Dunant hoped to further promote his ideas, including publishing a new edition of his book. However, their friendship later was strained by Dunant's unjustified accusations that Sonderegger, with Moynier in Geneva, was somehow conspiring against Dunant. Sonderegger died in 1904 at age 42. Despite their strained relationship, Dunant was deeply moved by the unexpected death. Wilhelm and Susanna Sonderegger's admiration for Dunant, felt by both even after Dunant's allegations, was passed on to their children. In 1935, their son Ren\u00e9 published a compilation of letters from Dunant to his father.\n<\/p><p>In September 1895, Georg Baumberger, the chief editor of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/St._Gallen\" title=\"St. Gallen\">St. Gall<\/a> newspaper <i>Die Ostschweiz<\/i>, wrote an article about the Red Cross founder, whom he had met and conversed with during a walk in Heiden a month earlier. The article entitled \"Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross\", appeared in the German Illustrated Magazine <i>\u00dcber Land und Meer<\/i>, and the article was soon reprinted in other publications throughout Europe. The article struck a chord, and he received renewed attention and support. He received the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize and a note from Pope <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leo_XIII\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leo XIII\">Leo XIII<\/a>. Because of support from Russian <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tsar\" title=\"Tsar\">tsarist<\/a> widow <a href=\"\/wiki\/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)\" title=\"Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)\">Maria Feodorovna<\/a> and other donations, his financial situation improved remarkably.\n<\/p><p>In 1897, Rudolf M\u00fcller, who was now working as a teacher in Stuttgart, wrote a book about the origins of the Red Cross, altering the official history to stress Dunant's role. The book also contained the text of <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/A_Memory_of_Solferino\" title=\"A Memory of Solferino\">A Memory of Solferino<\/a><\/i>. Dunant began an exchange of correspondence with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bertha_von_Suttner\" title=\"Bertha von Suttner\">Bertha von Suttner<\/a> and wrote numerous articles and writings. He was especially active in writing about women's rights, and in 1897 facilitated the founding of a \"Green Cross\" women's organization whose only section was briefly active in Brussels.\n<\/p><p>In 1901, Dunant was awarded the first-ever <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Peace_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Peace Prize\">Nobel Peace Prize<\/a> for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention. By public and private means, M\u00fcller, and later Norwegian military physician <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hans_Daae\" title=\"Hans Daae\">Hans Daae<\/a> (who had received a copy of M\u00fcller's book), advocated Dunant's case to the Nobel committee over the course of 4 years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Daae_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Daae-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Heudtlass_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Heudtlass-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> The award was jointly given to French pacifist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Passy\" title=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy<\/a>, founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization. The official congratulations which he received from the International Committee finally represented the rehabilitation of Dunant's reputation:\n<\/p><p>Moynier and the International Committee as a whole had also been nominated for the prize. Although Dunant was supported by a broad spectrum in the selection process, he was still a controversial candidate. Some argued that the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention had made war more attractive and imaginable by eliminating some of its suffering. Therefore, M\u00fcller, in a letter to the committee, argued that the prize should be divided between Dunant and Passy, who for some time in the debate had been the leading candidate to be the sole recipient of the prize. M\u00fcller also suggested that if a prize were to be warranted for Dunant, it should be given immediately because of his advanced age and ill health.\n<\/p><p>By dividing the prize between Passy, a pacifist, and Dunant, a humanitarian, the Nobel Committee set a precedent for the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize selection which would have significant consequences in later years. A section of Nobel's will had indicated that the prize should go to an individual who had worked to reduce or eliminate standing armies, or directly to promote peace conferences, which made Passy a natural choice for his peace work. On the other hand, the arguably distinct bestowal for humanitarian effort alone was seen by some as a wide interpretation of Nobel's will. However, another part of Nobel's testament marked the prize for the individual who had best enhanced the \"brotherhood of people,\" which could be interpreted more generally as seeing humanitarian work like Dunant's as connected to peacemaking as well. Many recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in later years can be assigned to either of these two categories first roughly established by the Nobel committee's decision in 1901.\n<\/p><p>Hans Daae succeeded in placing Dunant's part of the prize money, 104,000 Swiss Francs, in a Norwegian Bank and preventing access by his creditors. Dunant himself never spent any of the money during his lifetime, continuing to live simply and reserving it for bequests in his will to those who cared for him and charitable causes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Daae_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Daae-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Among several other awards in the following years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Heidelberg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Heidelberg\">University of Heidelberg<\/a>. He lived in the nursing home in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Paranoia\" title=\"Paranoia\">paranoia<\/a> about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier.

In his will, he donated funds to secure a \"free bed\" in the Heiden nursing home always to be available for a poor citizen of the region and deeded some money to friends and charitable organizations in Norway and Switzerland. The remaining funds went to his creditors partially relieving his debt; his inability to fully erase his debts was a major burden to him until his death.\n<\/p><p>His birthday, 8 May, is celebrated as the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The former nursing home in Heiden now houses the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Henry_Dunant_Museum\" title=\"Henry Dunant Museum\">Henry Dunant Museum<\/a>.

When light of a given wavelength is reflected back upon itself by a mirror, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Standing_wave\" title=\"Standing wave\">standing waves<\/a> are generated, much as the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into still water create standing waves when reflected back by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of ordinary <a href=\"\/wiki\/Coherence_(physics)\" title=\"Coherence (physics)\">incoherent<\/a> light, the standing waves are distinct only within a microscopically thin volume of space next to the reflecting surface.\n<\/p><p>Lippmann made use of this phenomenon by projecting an image onto a special <a href=\"\/wiki\/Photographic_plate\" title=\"Photographic plate\">photographic plate<\/a> capable of recording detail smaller than the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wavelength\" title=\"Wavelength\">wavelengths<\/a> of visible light.

After <a href=\"\/wiki\/Photographic_processing\" title=\"Photographic processing\">development<\/a>, the result was a structure of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lamella_(cell_biology)\" title=\"Lamella (cell biology)\">lamellae<\/a>, a very fine fringe pattern in distinct parallel layers composed of submicroscopic metallic silver grains, which was a permanent record of the standing waves. Throughout the emulsion, the spacing of the  lamellae corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed; \u03bb\/(2n), \u03bb being the wavelength of light in air and n is the refractive index of the emulsion. Thus colour information was stored locally. The larger the separation between the fringes, the longer was the wavelength recorded from the image colour, red being the longest.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The finished plate was illuminated from the front at a nearly <a href=\"\/wiki\/Perpendicular\" title=\"Perpendicular\">perpendicular<\/a> angle, using daylight or another source of white light containing the full range of wavelengths in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Visible_spectrum\" title=\"Visible spectrum\">visible spectrum<\/a>. At each point on the plate, light of approximately the same wavelength as the light which had generated the  lamellae was strongly reflected back toward the viewer. Light of other wavelengths which was not absorbed or scattered by the silver grains simply passed through the emulsion, usually to be absorbed by a black anti-reflection coating applied to the back of the plate after it had been developed. The wavelengths, and therefore the colours, of the light which had formed the original image were thus reconstituted and a full-colour image was seen.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Biedermann_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Biedermann-16\">[16]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In practice, the Lippmann process was not easy to use. Extremely fine-grained high-resolution <a href=\"\/wiki\/Photographic_emulsion\" title=\"Photographic emulsion\">photographic emulsions<\/a> are inherently much less light-sensitive than ordinary emulsions, so long exposure times were required. With a lens of large aperture and a very brightly sunlit subject, a camera exposure of less than one minute was sometimes possible, but exposures measured in minutes were typical. Pure spectral colours reproduced brilliantly, but the ill-defined broad bands of wavelengths reflected by real-world objects could be problematic. The process did not produce colour prints on paper and it proved impossible to make a good duplicate of a Lippmann colour photograph by rephotographing it, so each image was unique. A very shallow-angled prism was usually cemented to the front of the finished plate to deflect unwanted surface reflections, and this made plates of any substantial size impractical. The size of his early photographs was 4\u00a0cm by 4\u00a0cm, increased later to 6.5\u00a0cm by 9\u00a0cm.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup> The lighting and viewing arrangement required to see the colours to best effect precluded casual use.

In the case of actual multiple-wavelength colour holograms of this type, the colour information is recorded and reproduced just as in the Lippmann process, except that the highly coherent laser light passing through the recording medium and reflected back from the subject generates the required distinct standing waves throughout a relatively large volume of space, eliminating the need for reflection to occur immediately adjacent to the recording medium. Unlike Lippmann colour photography, however, the lasers, the subject and the recording medium must all be kept stable to within one quarter of a wavelength during the exposure in order for the standing waves to be recorded adequately or at all.\n<\/p><p>In 1908, Lippmann introduced what he called \"integral photography\", in which a plane array of closely spaced, small, spherical lenses is used to photograph a scene, recording images of the scene as it appears from many slightly different horizontal and vertical locations. When the resulting images are rectified and viewed through a similar array of lenses, a single integrated image, composed of small portions of all the images, is seen by each eye. The position of the eye determines which parts of the small images it sees. The effect is that the visual geometry of the original scene is reconstructed, so that the limits of the array seem to be the edges of a window through which the scene appears life-size and in three dimensions, realistically exhibiting parallax and perspective shift with any change in the position of the observer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]<\/a><\/sup> This principle of using numerous lenses or imaging apertures to record what was later termed a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Light_field\" title=\"Light field\">light field<\/a> underlies the evolving technology of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Light-field_camera\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Light-field camera\">light-field cameras and microscopes<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>When Lippmann presented the theoretical foundations of his \"integral photography\" in March 1908, it was impossible to accompany them with concrete results.

Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n<\/p><p>For his lifelong efforts in restoring the language of Provence, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral was one of the recipients of the 1904 Nobel Prize for Literature after having been nominated by two professors from the Swedish <a href=\"\/wiki\/Uppsala_University\" title=\"Uppsala University\">Uppsala University<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> The other winner that year, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jos%C3%A9_Echegaray\" title=\"Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\">Jos\u00e9 Echegaray<\/a>, was honored for his Spanish dramas.

The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Proven\u00e7al in his work and achievement.\n<\/p><p>In 1876, Mistral married a Burgundian woman, Marie-Louise Rivi\u00e8re (1857\u20131943) in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dijon_Cathedral\" title=\"Dijon Cathedral\">Dijon Cathedral<\/a> <i>(Cath\u00e9drale Saint-B\u00e9nigne de Dijon)<\/i>.  They had no children. Mistral died on 25 March 1914 in Maillane, the same village where he was born.\n<\/p><p>Mistral joined forces with one of his teachers, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Joseph_Roumanille\" title=\"Joseph Roumanille\">Joseph Roumanille<\/a>, and five other Proven\u00e7al poets and on 21 May 1854, they founded <a href=\"\/wiki\/F%C3%A9librige\" title=\"F\u00e9librige\">F\u00e9librige<\/a>, a literary and cultural association, which made it possible to promote the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Occitan_language\" title=\"Occitan language\">Occitan<\/a> language. Placed under the patronage of Saint Estelle, the movement also welcomed Catalan poets from Spain, driven out by Isabelle II.\n<\/p><p>The seven founders of the organization were (to use their Proven\u00e7al names):  J\u00f3us\u00e8 Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ans\u00e8ume Mati\u00e9u, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. F\u00e9librige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n<\/p><p>Mistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry.  He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n<\/p><p>Mistral is the author of <i>Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige<\/i> (1878\u20131886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Occitan_language\" title=\"Occitan language\">Occitan language<\/a>, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of <i>oc<\/i>, including Proven\u00e7al. Mistral owes to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fran%C3%A7ois_Vidal\" title=\"Fran\u00e7ois Vidal\">Fran\u00e7ois Vidal<\/a> the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n<\/p><p>Mistral's most important work is <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Mir%C3%A8io\" title=\"Mir\u00e8io\">Mir\u00e8io<\/a><\/i> (<i>Mireille<\/i>), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. <i>Mir\u00e8io<\/i>, a long poem in Proven\u00e7al consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven\u00e7al people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir\u00e8io in Provence) is a doublet of the word <i>meraviho<\/i> which means wonder.\n<\/p><p>Mistral used the occasion not only to promote his language but also to share the culture of an area. Among other tales, he tells of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer\" title=\"Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer\">Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer<\/a>, where according to legend the dragon <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tarasque\" title=\"Tarasque\">Tarasque<\/a> was driven out, and of the famous and ancient <a href=\"\/wiki\/Venus_of_Arles\" title=\"Venus of Arles\">Venus of Arles<\/a>. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven\u00e7al pronunciation.\n<\/p><p>The poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Proven\u00e7al landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n<\/p><p>Mistral dedicated his book to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alphonse_de_Lamartine\" title=\"Alphonse de Lamartine\">Alphonse de Lamartine<\/a> as follows:\n<\/p><p>\"To Lamartine:\n<\/p><p>To you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n<\/p><p>Lamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today!

Bunin was particularly impressed with Socrates's ideas on the intrinsic value of human individuality, it being a \"kind of focus for higher forces\" (quoted from Bunin's short story \"Back to Rome\"). As a purveyor of Socratic ideals, Bunin followed Leo Tolstoy; the latter's observation about beauty being \"the crown of virtue\" was Bunin's idea too.

This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson's views of life, and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable. The main thesis of the work is that <a href=\"\/wiki\/Laughter\" title=\"Laughter\">laughter<\/a> is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. People laugh at those who fail to adapt to the demands of society if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism.

The two became great friends. James's impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under the date of 4 October 1908:\n<\/p><p>As early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical <i>La Critique philosophique<\/i>, of Renouvier and Pillon, entitled <i><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Le_Sentiment_de_l%27Effort&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Le Sentiment de l'Effort (page does not exist)\">Le Sentiment de l'Effort<\/a><\/i>. Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal <i>Mind<\/i>: \"What is an Emotion?\" and \"On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology\". Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work, <i>Time and Free Will<\/i>. In the following years, 1890\u201391 appeared the two volumes of James's monumental work, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Principles_of_Psychology\" title=\"The Principles of Psychology\">The Principles of Psychology<\/a><\/i>, in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson.

In 1903, he wrote:\n<\/p><p>The most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hibbert_Lectures\" title=\"Hibbert Lectures\">Hibbert Lectures<\/a> (A Pluralistic Universe), which James gave at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Manchester_College,_Oxford\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Manchester College, Oxford\">Manchester College, Oxford<\/a>, shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he gained from Bergson's thought, and refers to his confidence in being \"able to lean on Bergson's authority\". (See further James's reservations about Bergson, below.)\n<\/p><p>The influence of Bergson had led James \"to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that <a href=\"\/wiki\/Logic\" title=\"Logic\">logic<\/a> is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be\". It had induced him, he continued, \"to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably\" as a method, for he found that \"reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it\".\n<\/p><p>These remarks, which appeared in James's book <i>A Pluralistic Universe<\/i> in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to investigate Bergson's philosophy for themselves, but no English translations of Bergson's major work had yet appeared. James, however, encouraged and assisted <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arthur_Mitchell_(physician)\" title=\"Arthur Mitchell (physician)\">Arthur Mitchell<\/a> in preparing an English translation of <i>Creative Evolution<\/i>. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the translation finished, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year, the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled <i>Truth and Reality<\/i> for the French translation of James's book, <i>Pragmatism<\/i>. In it, he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, together with certain important reservations.\n<\/p><p>From 5 to 11 April, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bologna\" title=\"Bologna\">Bologna<\/a>, in Italy, where he gave an address on \"Philosophical Intuition\". In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year, and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received. His speeches offered new perspectives and elucidated many passages in his three major works: <i>Time and Free Will<\/i>, <i>Matter and Memory<\/i>, and <i>Creative Evolution<\/i>. Although necessarily brief statements, they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.\n<\/p><p>In May 1911, Bergson gave two lectures entitled <i>The Perception of Change<\/i> (<i>La perception du changement<\/i>) at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Oxford\" title=\"University of Oxford\">University of Oxford<\/a>.

The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Roman_Catholic_Church\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Roman Catholic Church\">Roman Catholic Church<\/a>, however, banned Bergson's three books on the charge of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pantheism\" title=\"Pantheism\">pantheism<\/a> (that is, of conceiving of God as immanent to his Creation and of being himself created in the process of the Creation).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Fagot-Largeau_21-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fagot-Largeau-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup> They were placed on the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum\" title=\"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\">Index of prohibited books<\/a> (Decree of 1 June 1914).\n<\/p><p>In 1914, the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gifford_Lectures\" title=\"Gifford Lectures\">Gifford Lectures<\/a>, planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of <i>The Problem of Personality<\/i>, at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Edinburgh\" title=\"University of Edinburgh\">University of Edinburgh<\/a> in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war.\n<\/p><p>Bergson was not, however, silent during the conflict, and he gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article entitled <i>Wearing and Nonwearing Forces<\/i> (La force qui s'use et celle qui ne s'use pas), which appeared in a periodical of the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Poilu\" title=\"Poilu\">poilus<\/a><\/i>, <i>Le Bulletin des Arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise<\/i>.

Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of traveling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated in the negotiations which led to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I#Entry_of_the_United_States\" title=\"World War I\">entry of the United States<\/a> in the war. He was there when the French Mission under <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ren%C3%A9_Viviani\" title=\"Ren\u00e9 Viviani\">Ren\u00e9 Viviani<\/a> paid a visit in April and May 1917, following upon America's entry into the conflict. Viviani's book <i>La Mission fran\u00e7aise en Am\u00e9rique<\/i> (1917), contains a preface by Bergson.\n<\/p><p>Early in 1918, the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\">Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise<\/a><\/i> received Bergson officially when he took his seat among \"The Select Forty\" as successor to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Emile_Ollivier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Emile Ollivier\">Emile Ollivier<\/a> (the author of the historical work <i>L'Empire lib\u00e9ral<\/i>). A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows the central idea of his own philosophy in action. To no other philosopher has it fallen, during his lifetime, to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested.\n<\/p><p>As many of Bergson's contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he had them published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title <i>Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures<\/i> (reprinted as <i>Mind-Energy<\/i> \u2013 <i>L'\u00c9nergie spirituelle\u00a0: essais et conf\u00e9rences<\/i>). The advocate of Bergson's philosophy in England, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wildon_Carr\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wildon Carr\">Wildon Carr<\/a>, prepared an English translation under the title <i>Mind-Energy<\/i>. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, \"Life and Consciousness\", in a revised and developed form under the title \"Consciousness and Life\". Signs of Bergson's growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, <i>L'\u00c2me et le Corps<\/i>, which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson's famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, <i>The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism<\/i> (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as <i>Le cerveau et la pens\u00e9e\u00a0: une illusion philosophique<\/i>. Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of \"tension\" and \"detension\" as applied to the relation of matter and mind.\n<\/p><p>In June 1920, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Cambridge\" title=\"University of Cambridge\">University of Cambridge<\/a> honoured him with the degree of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Doctor_of_Letters\" title=\"Doctor of Letters\">Doctor of Letters<\/a>. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Coll\u00e8ge de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher <a href=\"\/wiki\/%C3%89douard_Le_Roy\" title=\"\u00c9douard Le Roy\">\u00c9douard Le Roy<\/a>, who supported a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Conventionalism\" title=\"Conventionalism\">conventionalist<\/a> stance on the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Foundations_of_mathematics\" title=\"Foundations of mathematics\">foundations of mathematics<\/a>, which was adopted by Bergson.<sup id=\"cite_ref-TheCreativeEvolution_34-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-TheCreativeEvolution-34\">[34]<\/a><\/sup> Le Roy, who also succeeded to Bergson at the <i>Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise<\/i> and was a fervent Catholic, extended to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Revelation\" title=\"Revelation\">revealed truth<\/a> his conventionalism, leading him to privilege faith, heart and sentiment to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dogma\" title=\"Dogma\">dogmas<\/a>, speculative theology and abstract reasoning.

It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community, but all by that time realized that Bergson's days as a philosophical luminary were past.

While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Duration_(philosophy)\" title=\"Duration (philosophy)\">Duration<\/a>, making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality.

For instance, he says in <i>The Creative Evolution<\/i> (chap. III) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible, man must throw himself in water, and only then can thought to consider swimming as possible.

Additionally, he argues that this view of a \"union with the divinity, brought about by efficacious ceremonies, is found even in quite primitive religions\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchweitzer19311_40-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchweitzer19311-40\">[39]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>On the other hand, a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the Greek mystery-cults that were popular in first-century A.D. society.

Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Adoption_(theology)\" title=\"Adoption (theology)\">sonship<\/a> to God as \"mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchweitzer19313_42-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchweitzer19313-42\">[41]<\/a><\/sup> He summarizes Pauline mysticism as \"being in Christ\" rather than \"being in God\".\n<\/p><p>Paul's imminent <a href=\"\/wiki\/Eschatology\" title=\"Eschatology\">eschatology<\/a> (from his background in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jewish_eschatology\" title=\"Jewish eschatology\">Jewish eschatology<\/a>) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ.

Rather, Paul uses the phrase \"being-in-Christ\" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of \"being-in-Christ\" is not a \"static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again\". The \"realistic\" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193113_43-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193113-43\">[42]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>One of Schweitzer's major arguments in <i>The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle<\/i> is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase \"being in Christ\", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading <a href=\"\/wiki\/Justification_by_faith\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Justification by faith\">justification by faith<\/a> as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Martin_Luther\" title=\"Martin Luther\">Martin Luther<\/a>, Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by \"being in Christ\". <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jaroslav_Pelikan\" title=\"Jaroslav Pelikan\">Jaroslav Pelikan<\/a>, in his foreword to <i>The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle<\/i>, points out that:\n<\/p><p>Schweitzer contrasts Paul's \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ to the \"symbolism\" of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hellenism_(Greek_culture)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hellenism (Greek culture)\">Hellenism<\/a>. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ rather than the \"symbolic\" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through <a href=\"\/wiki\/Deification\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Deification\">deification<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193116_45-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193116-45\">[44]<\/a><\/sup> After baptism, Christians are continually renewed throughout their lifetimes due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sacraments_of_the_Catholic_Church\" title=\"Sacraments of the Catholic Church\">Sacraments<\/a>). On the other hand, the Hellenist \"lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation\" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193117_46-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchweitzer193117-46\">[45]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Another major difference between Paul's \"realism\" and Hellenistic \"symbolism\" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter.

The committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be \"incorrect\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTESeaver195140_49-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeaver195140-49\">[48]<\/a><\/sup> He could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.\n<\/p><p>Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911.

At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in the University of Oxford, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, <i>The Decay and Restoration of Civilization<\/i> and <i>Civilization and Ethics<\/i>.

In 1925\u20136, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients.

Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian <a href=\"\/wiki\/Brahmin\" title=\"Brahmin\">Brahminic<\/a> philosophy.\n<\/p><p>For Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral.

Then a single <a href=\"\/wiki\/Microphone#Cardioid\" title=\"Microphone\">cardioid microphone<\/a> is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern.

He suggested that a strict and moralistic education had helped set these facets at odds. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Puritan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Puritan\">puritanical<\/a> constraints. He worked to achieve intellectual honesty. As a self-professed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pederast\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pederast\">pederast<\/a>, he used his writing to explore his struggle to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without betraying one's values.

His uncle was political economist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Charles_Gide\" title=\"Charles Gide\">Charles Gide<\/a>. His paternal family traced its roots to Italy.

Simon's use of self-consciously long sentences (often stretching across many pages and with parentheses sometimes interrupting a clause which is only completed pages later) can be seen to reference Proust's style, and Simon moreover makes use of certain Proustian settings (in <i>La Route des Flandres<\/i>, for example, the narrator's captain de Reixach is shot by a sniper concealed behind a hawthorn hedge or <i>haie d'aub\u00e9pines<\/i>, a reference to the meeting between Gilberte and the narrator across a hawthorn hedge in Proust's <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/%C3%80_la_recherche_du_temps_perdu\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu\">\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu<\/a><\/i>).\n<\/p><p>The Faulknerian influence is evident in the novels' extensive use of a fractured timeline with frequent and potentially disorienting analepsis (moments of chronological discontinuity), and of an extreme form of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_indirect_speech\" title=\"Free indirect speech\">free indirect speech<\/a> in which narrative voices (often unidentified) and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stream_of_consciousness_writing\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Stream of consciousness writing\">streams of consciousness<\/a> bleed into the words of the narration. The ghost of Faulkner looms particularly large in 1989's <i>L'Acacia<\/i>, which uses a number of non-sequential calendar dates covering a wide chronological period in lieu of chapter headings, a device borrowed from Faulkner's <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Sound_and_the_Fury\" title=\"The Sound and the Fury\">The Sound and the Fury<\/a><\/i>.\n<\/p><p>Despite these influences, Simon's work is thematically and stylistically highly original. War is a constant and central theme (indeed it is present in one form or another in almost all of Simon's published works), and Simon often contrasts various individuals' experiences of different historical conflicts in a single novel; World War I and the Second World War in <i>L'Acacia<\/i> (which also takes into account the impact of war on the widows of soldiers), the <a href=\"\/wiki\/French_Revolutionary_Wars\" title=\"French Revolutionary Wars\">French Revolutionary Wars<\/a> and the Second World War in <i>Les G\u00e9orgiques<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>In addition, many of the novels deal with the notion of family history, those myths and legends which are passed down through generations and which conspire in Simon's work to affect the protagonists' lives. In this regard, the novels make use of a number of leitmotifs which recur in different combinations between novels (a technique also employed by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Marguerite_Duras\" title=\"Marguerite Duras\">Marguerite Duras<\/a>), in particular, the suicide of an eighteenth-century ancestor and the death of a contemporary relative by sniper-fire. Finally, almost all of Simon's novels feature horses; Simon was himself an accomplished equestrian and fought in a mounted regiment during World War II (the ridiculousness of mounted soldiers fighting in a mechanised war is a major theme of <i>La Route des Flandres<\/i> and <i>Les G\u00e9orgiques<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>Simon's principal obsession, however, is with the ways in which humans experience time (another Modernist fascination). The novels often dwell on images of old age, such as the decaying 'LSM' or the old woman (that 'flaccid and ectoplasmic Cassandra') in <i>Les G\u00e9orgiques<\/i>, which are frequently seen through the uncomprehending eyes of childhood. Simon's use of family history equally attempts to show how individuals exist <i>in history<\/i>\u2014that is, how they might feel implicated in the lives and stories of their ancestors who died long ago.\n<\/p><p><a href=\"\/wiki\/Jean_Ricardou\" title=\"Jean Ricardou\">Jean Ricardou<\/a> (Director)\u00a0:\n<\/p><p>Essayist <a href=\"\/wiki\/Christopher_Hitchens\" title=\"Christopher Hitchens\">Christopher Hitchens<\/a> criticised Simon's deconstruction of <a href=\"\/wiki\/George_Orwell\" title=\"George Orwell\">George Orwell<\/a>'s account of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spanish_Civil_War\" title=\"Spanish Civil War\">Spanish Civil War<\/a>, claiming that Simon had himself fought \"on the side of the Stalintern forces.\"  In a further reference to the literary honours bestowed on Simon, Hitchens added: \"the award of the Nobel Prize to such a shady literary enterprise is a minor scandal, reflecting the intellectual rot which had been spread by pseudo intellectuals.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p><i>\u0152uvres<\/i> (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Biblioth%C3%A8que_de_la_Pl%C3%A9iade\" title=\"Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade\">Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade<\/a>):\n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/6f50d7aa9d2a6007be802597fa21bcb6f09869c0.jpg"},{"link":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Georges_Charpak","name":"Georges Charpak","year":1992,"category":"Physics","country":"France","text":"Georges Charpak ,  born in then Poland (Second Polish Republic), now Ukraine , Physics, 1992","date_of_birth":"1924-08-01T00:00:00.000","date_of_death":"2010-09-29T00:00:00.000","place_of_birth":"Dubrovytsia","place_of_death":"Paris","gender":"male","award_age":68,"born_in":"Poland","mini_bio":"<p><b>Georges Charpak<\/b> (<style data-mw-deduplicate=\"TemplateStyles:r1177148991\">.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}<\/style><span class=\"IPA-label IPA-label-small\">French:<\/span> <span class=\"IPA nowrap\" lang=\"fr-Latn-fonipa\"><a href=\"\/wiki\/Help:IPA\/French\" title=\"Help:IPA\/French\">[\u0283a\u0281pak]<\/a><\/span>; born <b>Jerzy Charpak<\/b>, (1 August 1924 \u2013 29 September 2010) was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polish_people\" title=\"Polish people\">Polish<\/a>-born French <a href=\"\/wiki\/Physicist\" title=\"Physicist\">physicist<\/a> who was awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physics\">Nobel Prize in Physics<\/a> in 1992.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Georges Charpak was born on 1 August 1924<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> as Jerzy Charpak to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jewish\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jewish\">Jewish<\/a> parents, Anna (Szapiro) and Maurice Charpak, in the village of D\u0105browica in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_Polish_Republic\" title=\"Second Polish Republic\">Poland<\/a> (now <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dubrovytsia\" title=\"Dubrovytsia\">Dubrovytsia<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ukraine\" title=\"Ukraine\">Ukraine<\/a>).

During her vacations as a child, she would spend hours analyzing insects and animals, comparing their behaviors and trying to understand why some run faster than others for example. Soon after, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi realized she was very talented in the sciences compared to her humanity courses. She expressed interest to her parents that she would like to attend university to study science or become a researcher. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi admitted that she was more interested in becoming a doctor but at the time she was under the false impression that studying medicine was both more expensive and lengthier than a career in science. After two years studying at the university, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi attempted to find part-time work in a laboratory to ensure that she had made the right career choice. After nearly a year of searching for laboratory work, she was finally accepted by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pasteur_Institute\" title=\"Pasteur Institute\">Pasteur Institute<\/a>. Her part-time work at the Pasteur Institute quickly became full-time. She began to only attend university to take the exams and had to rely on her friends\u2019 class notes because she was not regularly attending class.

After the new disease emerged (not yet named AIDS), a group of French physicians came to the Pasteur Institute to ask the rather simple question: is this new disease caused by a retrovirus? After much discussion with other colleagues, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Luc_Montagnier\" title=\"Luc Montagnier\">Luc Montagnier<\/a>, they concluded the agent causing this new disease may be a retrovirus but it was not <a href=\"\/wiki\/HTLV\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HTLV\">HTLV<\/a>, the only known retrovirus at the time, because of differing defining characteristics.  In the early 1980s, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was already familiar with the technique of detecting <a href=\"\/wiki\/Reverse_transcriptase\" title=\"Reverse transcriptase\">reverse transcriptase<\/a> activity. If reverse transcriptase activity is present, it confirms that the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Virus\" title=\"Virus\">virus<\/a> is a retrovirus. In December 1982, heavy research began and clinical observations suggested that the disease attacked immune cells because of the significant CD4 cell depletion. However, the depletion of the CD4 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lymphocytes\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lymphocytes\">lymphocytes<\/a> made it very difficult to isolate the virus in patients with the disease later known as, <a href=\"\/wiki\/AIDS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"AIDS\">AIDS<\/a>. Because of the difficulty isolating an infected cell from a patient with late disease progression, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to use a lymph node <a href=\"\/wiki\/Biopsy\" title=\"Biopsy\">biopsy<\/a> from a patient with generalized <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lymphadenopathy\" title=\"Lymphadenopathy\">lymphadenopathy<\/a>. Generalized lymphadenopathy was a common symptom of patients in the early stages of disease progression. In the second week of checking the biopsied cell cultures for reverse transcriptase activity, enzymatic activity was detected and increased for a short time until the reverse transcriptase activity decreased dramatically after the T-lymphocytes in the culture began to die. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to add lymphocytes from a blood donor in order to save the culture and it proved successful after the virus transmitted to the newly added lymphocytes from the blood donor and significant reverse transcriptase activity was again detected. At this point, the virus was named LAV for Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus, which would later be renamed to HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. 1983 marked the beginning of Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's career researching HIV that continued until her retirement. 1983 was also the year it became clear that HIV was not only a target for what was known as the 4Hs, homosexuals, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hemophiliacs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hemophiliacs\">hemophiliacs<\/a>, Haitians and heroin addicts, but that HIV was also targeting heterosexuals\u2009\u2013 making the likelihood that the HIV related disease, AIDS, was an epidemic very high.<sup id=\"cite_ref-IAS_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-IAS-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-nobel_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobel-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Francoise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi remained at the Pasteur Institute and was appointed head of the Biology of Retroviruses Unit in 1992.

Currently, the unit is working on vaccine research against HIV and the correlates of protection against AIDS for immunotherapy.

In metathesis, chemists break double bonds more easily by introducing a catalyst\u2014that is, a substance that starts or speeds up a chemical reaction.

He showed that the reaction involves two <a href=\"\/wiki\/Double_bond\" title=\"Double bond\">double bonds<\/a>. One of the double bonds connects two parts of an organic molecule. The other double bond connects a metal-based catalyst to a fragment of an organic molecule. In metathesis, these two double bonds combine and split to make four single bonds. The single bonds form a ring that connects the metal catalyst, the organic fragment, and the two parts of the organic molecule. The metal catalyst then breaks off from the ring, carrying away part of the organic molecule. This process leaves the fragment attached to the remainder of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organic_molecule\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Organic molecule\">organic molecule<\/a> with a double bond, forming a new organic compound.

Jean Dausset died on June 6, 2009, in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Majorca\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Majorca\">Majorca<\/a>, Spain, at the age of 92.\n<\/p><p><b>Jean-Baptiste-Gabriel-Joachim Dausset<\/b> was born on 19 October 1916, in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Toulouse\" title=\"Toulouse\">Toulouse<\/a>, France. He was the youngest of four children of Henri Dausset and Elisabeth Dausset (born Renard). His father was from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\">Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es<\/a>, and was a doctor by profession, and his mother was a housewife from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lorraine_(region)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Lorraine (region)\">Lorraine<\/a>. Following the end of <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">World War I<\/a> the Dausset family moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Biarritz\" title=\"Biarritz\">Biarritz<\/a> where Jean spent most of his childhood. His father was head doctor at the Bayonne Hospital, a position that would make a great impression on Jean. Dausset was home schooled by his mother, as well as by a tutor, who would periodically come to the house. At the age of 11, Dausset and his family moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Paris\" title=\"Paris\">Paris<\/a>. He began his formal schooling at the Lyc\u00e9e Michelet, at age 15. After earning his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Baccalaur%C3%A9at\" title=\"Baccalaur\u00e9at\">Baccalaur\u00e9at<\/a> in mathematics, Dausset was convinced by his father to study medicine at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Paris\" title=\"University of Paris\">University of Paris<\/a>. Both of Dausset's parents died just after he became an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Extern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Extern\">extern<\/a> at the Paris Hospitals, at the age of 19. Dausset failed to pass an internship entrance exam at the Paris Hospitals, and was preparing for a second attempt when <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a> broke out.\n<\/p><p>Dausset was enlisted in the French army, and sent off to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Northern_Italy\" title=\"Northern Italy\">Northern Italy<\/a> for a year. Upon his return to Paris in 1940, Dausset studied ardently and passed his medical <a href=\"\/wiki\/Intern\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Intern\">internship<\/a> exam. Soon after passing his exams, Dausset joined the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Free_French_Forces\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free French Forces\">Free French Forces<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/North_Africa\" title=\"North Africa\">North Africa<\/a> as an ambulance worker. He was originally stationed in Morocco, but was later sent to the more active Tunisia. Dausset got his first taste of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hematology\" title=\"Hematology\">hematology<\/a> when he had to perform numerous <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blood_transfusion\" title=\"Blood transfusion\">blood transfusions<\/a> on wounded soldiers. As the war was winding down in 1944, Dausset returned to Paris where he worked in the Regional Blood Transfusion Center at the Saint-Antoine Hospital.\n<\/p><p>After the war, Dausset worked as an intern at the Paris Hospitals, which were in a state of disrepair and badly needed structural reform. Dausset formed a group of radical doctors who pushed for change in the French medical system. Due to his activist role in this group, Dausset was appointed as the Advisor to the Cabinet of the National Ministry of Education. The physician <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Debr%C3%A9\" title=\"Robert Debr\u00e9\">Robert Debr\u00e9<\/a> worked with Dausset, and pushed the government into forming a committee for the reform of medical education. Hospitals were joined with universities for the first time in France, and doctors were required to instruct classes to medical students. With the newly introduced system of university research hospitals, research began within the hospitals themselves, as opposed to in the universities alone, and full-time work for doctors was established (<i>Debr\u00e9 reform<\/i> of 11 and 30 December 1958).<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>After World War II Dausset worked with Professor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Marcel_Bessis\" title=\"Marcel Bessis\">Marcel Bessis<\/a> who had developed a new transfusion technique called <a href=\"\/wiki\/Exchange_transfusion\" title=\"Exchange transfusion\">exchange transfusion<\/a>. He worked as an immunohematologist and was interested in anaemic patients who required blood transfusions, he found that these patients lacked both red and white blood cells. In 1948, Dausset went to work as an intern in the Children's Hospital in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Boston\" title=\"Boston\">Boston<\/a>. He worked there in a hematology lab for about four years.\n<\/p><p>He returned to France in 1952 and once again took up the position of an intern with Marcel Bessis. It was during this time that Dausset conducted his first official research. With Bessis, Dausset discovered the first antigen-presenting <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leucocyte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Leucocyte\">leucocyte<\/a>, but it was only officially described in 1958. Between the years 1952 and 1957 he collaborated with many researchers such as Gilbert Malinvaud and Jacques and Monique Colombani. From 1952 to 1957, majority of Dausset's time went into developing techniques and developing further ways of confirming the presence of certain antibodies. He was made the head of research at Professor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Georges_Marchal\" title=\"Georges Marchal\">Georges Marchal<\/a>\u2019s immunohematology laboratory in the Broussais Hospital. During this time, Dausset performed blood transfusions between a voluntary donor and patients in order to further his research in the field of immune responses in the body. He was testing the ability of the antigen-presenting leucocytes in the recipient\u2019s body, which came originally from the donor\u2019s blood. In 1958, Dausset discovered an antibody called MAC which was a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Agglutination_(biology)\" title=\"Agglutination (biology)\">leuco-aggluntinate<\/a>; the abbreviation MAC actually stands for the initials of the names of the donors whose blood Dausset and his colleagues had used during the research. From 1960 to 1965 Dausset worked primarily on improving <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organ_transplantation\" title=\"Organ transplantation\">organ transplantation<\/a> techniques and the mechanisms involved in enhancing the body\u2019s ability to accept the new tissue. To do this, Dausset again used the blood of voluntary donors and patients to see what differences lay in the blood of the two individuals and how to minimize these differences.\n1965 was a crucial year for research. There was an intense competition amongst the researchers of the immunohematology field as everyone was on the brink of making a major discovery in the genetic and transplantation research. During this time, Dausset worked with Paul Ivany in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Prague\" title=\"Prague\">Prague<\/a> and they used leuco-agglutination and lymphocyte toxicity techniques to make some very significant discoveries. They discovered the Hu-1 antigen and the H-2 antigen.\n<\/p><p>In 1963 Jean Dausset became the head of the immunology at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/H%C3%B4pital_Saint-Louis\" title=\"H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis\">H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis<\/a> in 1963. This is when he discovered the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" title=\"Human leukocyte antigen\">HLA system<\/a>, with Felix Rapaport; by performing skin transplant experiments on volunteers and showed that success depended on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Histocompatibility\" title=\"Histocompatibility\">histocompatibility<\/a>.\nDausset was the assistant director of the Research Institute in Blood diseases until 1968, he then became the director of the \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Institut_National_de_la_Sant%C3%A9_et_de_la_Recherche_M%C3%A9dicale\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale\">Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale<\/a>\"(INSERM) transplantation immunogenetics research unit.  Dausset founded France Transplant and France Greffe de Moelle, which brings matching donor organs to recipients and provides <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bone_marrow\" title=\"Bone marrow\">bone marrow<\/a> for transplant respectively.\n<\/p><p>Dausset began his research shortly after obtaining his medical degree in 1945, while working as an intern in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hematology\" title=\"Hematology\">hematology<\/a> lab at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston.  His first paper was published in 1950, and dealt with the detection of incomplete antibodies using <a href=\"\/wiki\/Trypsin\" title=\"Trypsin\">trypsinized<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Erythrocyte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Erythrocyte\">erythrocytes<\/a> in a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blood_plasma\" title=\"Blood plasma\">plasmatic medium<\/a>, a technique that displayed improved sensitivity over other techniques used at the time.  He went on to publish more works in the field of hematology, including developing a technique in 1952 for the removal of plasma from red blood cells to be used in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blood_transfusion\" title=\"Blood transfusion\">transfusions<\/a> to patients somehow intolerant of whole blood transfusions.  In 1952 he returned to France and continued his research, particularly focusing on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hemolytic_anemia\" title=\"Hemolytic anemia\">hemolytic anemia<\/a>, and publishing several works dealing with various forms of blood cell agglutination.  It was during this period of research, in 1954, when Dausset first observed an anti-<a href=\"\/wiki\/White_blood_cell\" title=\"White blood cell\">leucocyte<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Agglutination_(biology)\" title=\"Agglutination (biology)\">agglutinating<\/a> substance, though it was not until 1958 that he identified an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Isoantibodies\" title=\"Isoantibodies\">isoantibody<\/a> specific to leucocytes, and published his findings.  It was this finding and the extensive cascade of work that followed that would ultimately earn Dausset his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Prize\">Nobel Prize<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>General research in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antibodies\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Antibodies\">antibodies<\/a>, agglutination, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anemia\" title=\"Anemia\">anemia<\/a> continued in the years following this 1958 paper.  In 1962, Dausset published an examination of the correlation between leuco-agglutination and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Skin_graft\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skin graft\">skin graft<\/a> tolerance, his first observation of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antigen\" title=\"Antigen\">antigens<\/a>\u2019 impact on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Histocompatibility\" title=\"Histocompatibility\">histocompatibility<\/a>.  His next paper on the subject was published in 1964, when he observed a clear relationship between leucocyte antigen compatibility and antibody response to skin grafts.  This finding sparked a flurry of research in the topic of histocompatibility, and by the end of 1965 Dausset had published over a dozen papers exploring leucocyte antigens and their relevance to histocompatibility.  After identifying that a two-<a href=\"\/wiki\/Allele\" title=\"Allele\">allele<\/a> leucocyte antigen group had an influence on histocompatibility and observing the induction of hyper-sensitivity to skin grafts following injection of leucocyte fractions, Dausset developed a system for grouping leucocyte antigens on the basis of histocompatibility.  Following this, he put forth the hypothesis that all known leucocyte antigens were part of a single complex, a complex which he named Hu-1.  This complex would later become known as one of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Major_Histocompatibility_Complex\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Major Histocompatibility Complex\">Major Histocompatibility Complexes<\/a> (MHC), specifically those termed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Human_Leukocyte_Antigen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Human Leukocyte Antigen\">Human Leucocyte Antigens<\/a> (HLA).  Dausset's further work in 1965 examining the effects of Hu-1 antigen injection on skin graft rejection further confirmed the conclusion that this Hu-1 complex was indeed a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organ_transplantation\" title=\"Organ transplantation\">transplantation<\/a> antigen, a conclusion which would in time have profound effects on the transplantation process.\n<\/p><p>In the years to come, Dausset continued his research on the Hu-1 complex.  Through 1966-1967 he published several more papers on the subject, including a paper summarizing the relevance of Hu-1 antigens to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oncogenesis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Oncogenesis\">oncogenesis<\/a> and transplantation, development of the use of a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Platelet\" title=\"Platelet\">platelet<\/a> complementation fixation test to identify which antigens are present, and the discovery that Hu-1 is homologous to the mouse H-2 complex, which also functions in histocompatibility.  Toward the end of 1967 he confirmed through familial studies that all discovered antigens were in fact part of a single system.  Following 1967, Dausset participated in numerous other studies pertaining to the complex (which was renamed HLA in 1968), particularly those examining the genetic basis for the antigens\u2019 transmission, along with publishing a number of other papers for which he claimed primary authorship.  For his contribution to these studies as well as his ultimate role in the discovery of this crucial antigen, Jean Dausset received the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_and_Medicine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine\">Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine<\/a> in 1980.\n<\/p><p>Following his reception of the Nobel Prize, Dausset's personal research slowed considerably.  He contributed to multiple studies, particularly a number relating to genetics, but did not publish anything for which he claimed primary authorship for over a decade.  He retired in 2003, at the age of 87.\n<\/p><p>In 1975, Dausset suspected that his name had been entered in the nominations for the Nobel Prize. However, nothing came of this until February 1980, when rumours were circulating in the scientific community about his possible candidacy. At this point, Dausset was planning on going to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quebec\" title=\"Quebec\">Quebec<\/a>, Canada to do a conference series throughout the province. He was in a dilemma because if did win, he did not want to be away from his family and colleagues, and yet, were he to stay in France, people would suspect that he was sure of winning and he might set himself up for disappointment. So instead, he decided to stay in Paris, but to stay out of the public eye. He was unsurprisingly awarded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Prize\">Nobel Prize<\/a> 1980, which he shared with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Baruj_Benacerraf\" title=\"Baruj Benacerraf\">Baruj Benacerraf<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/George_Davis_Snell\" title=\"George Davis Snell\">George Davis Snell<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In 1984 Dausset founded the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fondation_Jean_Dausset-CEPH\" title=\"Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH\">Centre D\u2019\u00e9tude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)<\/a>, aiming to detect the major genes in humans that are responsible for diseases outside the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Human_leukocyte_antigen\" title=\"Human leukocyte antigen\">HLA system<\/a>.  Localization of these genes was a crucial step in cloning and identifying them, this was a breakthrough for medical genetics.  The CEPH system contributed <a href=\"\/wiki\/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA<\/a> from 61 large families to international centers that were responsible for mapping the human genome.

For instance, if a bacterium finds itself in a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Broth\" title=\"Broth\">broth<\/a> containing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lactose\" title=\"Lactose\">lactose<\/a>, rather than the simpler sugar <a href=\"\/wiki\/Glucose\" title=\"Glucose\">glucose<\/a>, it must adapt itself to the need to 1) import lactose, 2) cleave lactose to its constituents glucose and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Galactose\" title=\"Galactose\">galactose<\/a>, and 3) convert the galactose to glucose. It was known that cells ramp up their production of the enzymes that do these steps when exposed to lactose, rather than wastefully producing these enzymes all the time. Studies of enzyme activity control were progressing through theories of the (allosteric) action of small <a href=\"\/wiki\/Molecule\" title=\"Molecule\">molecules<\/a> on the enzyme molecule itself (switching it on or off), but the method of controlling the enzyme production was not well understood at the time.\n<\/p><p>With the earlier determination of the structure and central importance of <a href=\"\/wiki\/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA<\/a>, it became clear that all proteins were being produced in some way from its genetic code, and that this step might form a key control point. Jacob and Monod made key experimental and theoretical discoveries that demonstrated that in the case of the lactose system outlined above (in the bacterium <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Escherichia_coli\" title=\"Escherichia coli\">E. coli<\/a><\/i>), there are specific proteins that are devoted to repressing the transcription of the DNA to its product (<a href=\"\/wiki\/RNA\" title=\"RNA\">RNA<\/a>, which in turn is <a href=\"\/wiki\/Code\" title=\"Code\">decoded<\/a> into <a href=\"\/wiki\/Protein\" title=\"Protein\">protein<\/a>).\n<\/p><p>This repressor (the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Lac_repressor\" title=\"Lac repressor\">lac repressor<\/a>) is made in all cells, binding directly to DNA at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gene\" title=\"Gene\">genes<\/a> it controls, and physically preventing the transcription apparatus from gaining access to the DNA. In the presence of lactose, some of the lactose is converted to allolactose, which binds to the repressor making it no longer able to bind to DNA, and the transcriptional repression is lifted. In this way, a robust <a href=\"\/wiki\/Feedback_loop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feedback loop\">feedback loop<\/a> is constructed that allows the set of lactose-digesting proteins products to be made only when they are needed.\n<\/p><p>Jacob and Monod extended this repressor model to all genes in all <a href=\"\/wiki\/Organism\" title=\"Organism\">organisms<\/a> in their initial exuberance.

In summarizing recent progress in several areas of biology, including his own research, Monod highlights the ways in which information is found to take physical form and hence become capable of influencing events in the world. For example, the information allowing a protein enzyme to \"select\" only one of several similar compounds as the substrate of a chemical reaction is encoded in the precise three-dimensional shape of the enzyme; that precise shape is itself encoded by the linear sequence of amino acids constituting the protein; and that particular sequence of amino acids is encoded by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene for that enzyme.\n<\/p><p>In the title of the book, \"necessity\" refers to the fact that the enzyme <i>must<\/i> act as it does, catalyzing a reaction with one substrate but not another, according to the constraints imposed by its structure. While the enzyme itself cannot be said in any meaningful way to have a choice about its activity, the thrust of Jacob and Monod's Nobel prize-winning research was to show how a bacterial cell can \"choose\" whether or not to carry out the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.  As Monod explains, one way the cell can make such a choice is by either synthesizing the enzyme or not, in response to its chemical environment.  However, the synthesis\/no synthesis choice is in turn governed by necessary biochemical interactions between a repressor protein, the gene for the enzyme, and the substrate of the enzyme, which interact so that the outcome (enzyme synthesis or not) differs according to the variable composition of the cell's chemical environment.  The hierarchical, modular organization of this system clearly implies that additional regulatory elements can exist that govern, are governed by, or otherwise interact with any given set of regulatory components.  Because, in general, the bacterial activity that results from these regulatory circuits is in accord with what is beneficial for the bacterial cell's survival at that time, the bacterium as a whole can be described as making rational choices, even though the bacterial components involved in deciding whether to make an enzyme (repressor, gene, and substrate) have no more choice about their activities than does the enzyme itself.\n<\/p><p>Monod shows a paradigm of how choice at one level of biological organization (metabolic activity) is generated by necessary (choiceless) interactions at another level (gene regulation); the ability to choose arises from a complex system of feedback loops that connect these interactions.  He goes on to explain how the capacity of biological systems to retain information, combined with chance variations during the replication of information (i.e. genetic mutations) that are individually rare but commonplace in aggregate, leads to the differential preservation of that information which is most successful at maintaining and replicating itself.  Monod writes that this process, acting over long periods of time, is a sufficient explanation (indeed the only plausible explanation) for the complexity and teleonomic activity of the biosphere.  Hence, the combined effects of chance and necessity, which are amenable to scientific investigation, account for our existence and the universe we inhabit, without the need to invoke mystical, supernatural, or religious explanations.\n<\/p><p>While acknowledging the likely evolutionary origin of a human need for explanatory myths, in the final chapter of <i>Chance and Necessity<\/i> Monod advocates an objective (hence value-free) scientific worldview as a guide to assessing truth.  He describes this as an \"ethics of knowledge\" that disrupts the older philosophical, mythological and religious ontologies, which claim to provide both ethical values and a standard for judging truth. For Monod, assessing truth separate from any value judgement is what frees human beings to act authentically, by requiring that they <i>choose<\/i> the ethical values that motivate their actions. He concludes that \"man at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe, out of which he has emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below: it is for him to choose\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chance_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chance-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup>  While apparently bleak, in comparison to the concepts that humanity belongs to some inevitable, universal process, or that a benevolent God created and protects us, an acceptance of the scientific assessment described in the first part of the quotation is, for Monod, the only possible basis of an authentic, ethical human life.  It is reasonable to conclude that Monod himself did not find this position bleak; the quotation he chose from Camus to introduce <i>Chance and Necessity<\/i> ends with the sentence: \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n<\/p><p>In 1973, Jacques Monod was one of the signatories of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Humanist_Manifesto_II\" title=\"Humanist Manifesto II\">Humanist Manifesto II<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Sociologist Howard L.

While Monod does not explicitly address mind or consciousness, his scientific research demonstrated that biology includes feedback loops that govern interacting systems of biochemical reactions, so that the system as a whole can be described as having a purpose and making choices. Monod's philosophical writing indicates that he recognized the implication that such systems could arise and be elaborated upon by evolution through natural selection. The importance of Monod's work as a bridge between the chance and necessity of evolution and biochemistry on the one hand, and the human realm of choice and ethics on the other, can be judged by his influence on philosophers, biologists and computer scientists such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Daniel_Dennett\" title=\"Daniel Dennett\">Daniel Dennett<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Douglas_Hofstadter\" title=\"Douglas Hofstadter\">Douglas Hofstadter<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Marvin_Minsky\" title=\"Marvin Minsky\">Marvin Minsky<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Richard_Dawkins\" title=\"Richard Dawkins\">Richard Dawkins<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In addition to sharing a Nobel Prize, Monod was also a recipient of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\">L\u00e9gion d'honneur<\/a> and elected member of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences\" title=\"American Academy of Arts and Sciences\">American Academy of Arts and Sciences<\/a> in 1960.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]<\/a><\/sup> He was elected a member of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_Academy_of_Sciences\" title=\"National Academy of Sciences\">National Academy of Sciences<\/a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup> the <a href=\"\/wiki\/American_Philosophical_Society\" title=\"American Philosophical Society\">American Philosophical Society<\/a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]<\/a><\/sup> and a <a href=\"\/wiki\/List_of_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_elected_in_1968\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1968\">Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1968<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Lwoff-385_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Lwoff-385-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> The Institut Jacques Monod, funded jointly by the CNRS and the University of Paris, is one of the main centers for basic research in biology in the Paris area.
