Nevertheless, in 1943, Lee directly applied to and was admitted by the National Che Kiang University (now <a href=\"\/wiki\/Zhejiang_University\" title=\"Zhejiang University\">Zhejiang University<\/a>). Initially, Lee registered as a student in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Very quickly, Lee's talent was discovered and his interest in physics grew rapidly.

Soon, his focus turned to particle physics and the developing puzzle of <a href=\"\/wiki\/K_meson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"K meson\">K meson<\/a> decays. Lee realized in early 1956 that the key to the puzzle was parity non-conservation.  At Lee's suggestion, the first experimental test was on hyperion decay by the Steinberger group. At that time, the experimental result gave only an indication of a 2 standard deviation effect of possible <a href=\"\/wiki\/Parity_violation\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Parity violation\">parity violation<\/a>. Encouraged by this feasibility study, Lee made a systematic study of possible Time reversal (T), Parity (P), Charge Conjugation (C), and <a href=\"\/wiki\/CP_violation\" title=\"CP violation\">CP violations<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Weak_interaction\" title=\"Weak interaction\">weak interactions<\/a> with collaborators, including C.

During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to persuade <a href=\"\/wiki\/Edward_Teller\" title=\"Edward Teller\">Edward Teller<\/a> against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony played a major role in the revocation of Oppenheimer's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Security_clearance\" title=\"Security clearance\">security clearance<\/a>.

Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_fluctuation\" title=\"Quantum fluctuation\">quantum fluctuations<\/a> of the electromagnetic field, which gave the electron more energy. According to pre-war <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_electrodynamics\" title=\"Quantum electrodynamics\">quantum electrodynamics<\/a> (QED), the energy of the electron consisted of the bare energy it had when uncoupled from an electromagnetic field, and the self-energy resulting from the electromagnetic coupling, but both were unobservable, since the electromagnetic field cannot be switched off. QED gave infinite values for the self-energies; but the Lamb shift showed that they were both real and finite. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hans_Kramers\" title=\"Hans Kramers\">Hans Kramers<\/a> proposed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Renormalization\" title=\"Renormalization\">renormalization<\/a> as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBrownLee2006157\u2013158_87-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrownLee2006157%E2%80%93158-87\">[86]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Bethe_1947_89-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bethe_1947-89\">[88]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Bethe managed to perform the calculation on the train from New York to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Schenectady\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Schenectady\">Schenectady<\/a>, where he was working for <a href=\"\/wiki\/General_Electric\" title=\"General Electric\">General Electric<\/a>. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculation. The bare energy was easily removed as it was already included in the observed mass of the electron. The self energy term now increased logarithmically instead of linearly, making it mathematically convergent. Bethe arrived at a value for the Lamb shift of 1040\u00a0MHz, extremely close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. His paper, published in the <i>Physical Review<\/i> in August 1947, was only three pages long and contained just twelve mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. It had been presumed that the infinities indicated that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required; Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bethe_1947_89-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bethe_1947-89\">[88]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBrownLee2006158\u2013159_90-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrownLee2006158%E2%80%93159-90\">[89]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>One of Bethe's most famous papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alpher%E2%80%93Bethe%E2%80%93Gamow_paper\" title=\"Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper\">Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-91\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-91\">[90]<\/a><\/sup> <a href=\"\/wiki\/George_Gamow\" title=\"George Gamow\">George Gamow<\/a> added Bethe's name (in absentia) without consulting him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ralph_Alpher\" title=\"Ralph Alpher\">Ralph Alpher<\/a>'s wishes.

He then computed the transfer matrix of the \"Ising ladder\", meaning two 1D Ising models side-by-side, connected by links. The transfer matrix is then 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04. He repeated this for up to six 1D Ising models, resulting in transfer matrices of up to 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064.

The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel's experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin's theory was provided when Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin's ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment,<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]<\/a><\/sup> which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.  Of course, by then Avery, along with McCloud (and earlier, McCarty) was well on the way to showing the genetic capability of DNA.\n<\/p><p>In 1945, Delbr\u00fcck, Luria, and Hershey set up a course in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bacteriophage\" title=\"Bacteriophage\">bacteriophage<\/a> genetics at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory\" title=\"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<\/a> on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Long_Island,_New_York\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Long Island, New York\">Long Island, New York<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Vanderbilt_21-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Vanderbilt-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup>  This <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phage_Group\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Phage Group\">Phage Group<\/a> spurred <a href=\"\/wiki\/Molecular_biology\" title=\"Molecular biology\">molecular biology<\/a>'s early development.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup>  Delbr\u00fcck received the 1969 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine<\/a>, shared with Luria and Hershey \"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Nobel_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Nobel-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Vanderbilt_21-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Vanderbilt-21\">[21]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-FischerLipson_26-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FischerLipson-26\">[26]<\/a><\/sup> The committee also noted that \"The honour in the first place goes to Delbr\u00fcck who transformed bacteriophage research from vague empiricism to an exact science.

His interest in cancer stem cells was strongly influenced by evidence that in addition to genomic mutations, epigenetic modification of a cell may contribute to the development or progression of cancer.\n<\/p><p>Dulbecco and his group demonstrated that the infection of normal cells with certain types of viruses (oncoviruses) led to the incorporation of virus-derived <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gene\" title=\"Gene\">genes<\/a> into the host-cell <a href=\"\/wiki\/Genome\" title=\"Genome\">genome<\/a>, and that this event lead to the transformation (the acquisition of a tumor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phenotype\" title=\"Phenotype\">phenotype<\/a>) of those cells. As demonstrated by Temin and Baltimore, who shared the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\" title=\"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\">Nobel Prize<\/a> with Dulbecco, the transfer of viral genes to the cell is mediated by an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Enzyme\" title=\"Enzyme\">enzyme<\/a> called <a href=\"\/wiki\/Reverse_transcriptase\" title=\"Reverse transcriptase\">reverse transcriptase<\/a> (or, more precisely, RNA-dependent <a href=\"\/wiki\/DNA_polymerase\" title=\"DNA polymerase\">DNA polymerase<\/a>), which replicates the viral genome (in this case made of <a href=\"\/wiki\/RNA\" title=\"RNA\">RNA<\/a>) into <a href=\"\/wiki\/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA<\/a>, which is later incorporated in the host genome.\n<\/p><p>Oncoviruses are the cause of some forms of human <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cancer\" title=\"Cancer\">cancers<\/a>. Dulbecco's study gave a basis for a precise understanding of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Molecule\" title=\"Molecule\">molecular<\/a> mechanisms by which they propagate, thus allowing humans to better fight them. Furthermore, the mechanisms of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Carcinogenesis\" title=\"Carcinogenesis\">carcinogenesis<\/a> mediated by oncoviruses closely resemble the process by which normal cells degenerate into cancer cells.

It consists of one outer-sphere electron transfer between substances of the same atomic structure likewise to Marcus\u2019s studies between bivalent and trivalent iron ions. Electron transfer may be one of the most basic forms of chemical reaction but without it life cannot exist. Electron transfer is used in all respiratory functions as well as photosynthesis. In the process of oxidizing food molecules, two hydrogen ions, two electrons, and an oxygen molecule react to make an exothermic reaction as well as H<sub>2<\/sub>O (water). Due to fact that electron transfer is such a broad, common, and essential reaction within nature, Marcus's theory has become vital within the field of chemistry.\n<\/p><p><b>2H<sup>+<\/sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212<\/sup> + 1\/2 O<sub>2<\/sub> \u2192 H<sub>2<\/sub>O + heat<\/b>\n<\/p><p>A type of chemical reaction linked to his many studies of electron transfer would be the transfer of an electron between metal ions in different states of oxidation. An example of this type of chemical reaction would be one between a bivalent and a trivalent iron ion in an aqueous solution. In Marcus's time chemists were astonished at the slow rate in which this specific reaction took place. This attracted many chemists in the 1950s and is also what began Marcus's interests in electron transfer.  Marcus made many studies based on the principles that were found within this chemical reaction, and through his studies was able to create his famous Marcus theory. This theory gave way to new experimental programs that contributed to all branches within chemistry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>As of his 100th birthday, he is still active doing research. <sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Marcus was awarded honorary degrees from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Chicago\" title=\"University of Chicago\">University of Chicago<\/a> in 1983, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Goteborg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Goteborg\">University of Goteborg<\/a> in 1986, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Polytechnic_Institute_of_Brooklyn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn\">Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn<\/a> in 1987, <a href=\"\/wiki\/McGill_University\" title=\"McGill University\">McGill University<\/a> in 1988, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Queen%27s_University_at_Kingston\" title=\"Queen's University at Kingston\">Queen's University<\/a> in 1993, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_New_Brunswick\" title=\"University of New Brunswick\">University of New Brunswick<\/a> in 1993, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Oxford\" title=\"University of Oxford\">University of Oxford<\/a> in 1995, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill\" title=\"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<\/a> in 1996, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Yokohama_National_University\" title=\"Yokohama National University\">Yokohama National University<\/a> in 1996, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign\">University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign<\/a> in 1997,  the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology\">Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology<\/a> in 1998, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Technical_University_of_Valencia\" title=\"Technical University of Valencia\">Technical University of Valencia<\/a> in 1999, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Northwestern_University\" title=\"Northwestern University\">Northwestern University<\/a> in 2000, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Waterloo\" title=\"University of Waterloo\">University of Waterloo<\/a> in 2002, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nanyang_Technological_University\" title=\"Nanyang Technological University\">Nanyang Technological University<\/a> in 2010, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tumkur_University\" title=\"Tumkur University\">Tumkur University<\/a> in 2012, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Hyderabad\" title=\"University of Hyderabad\">University of Hyderabad<\/a> in 2012, and  the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Calgary\" title=\"University of Calgary\">University of Calgary<\/a> in 2013.

The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun's ultraviolet light.

The work for which he won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics was a series of articles published in 1967 and 1968 which established what has become the standard framework for analyzing \"games of incomplete information\", situations in which the various strategic decisionmakers have different information about the parameters of the game. He resolved the problem of how players could make decisions while not knowing what each other knows by modelling the situation with initial moves by Nature using known probabilities to choose the parameters, with some players observing Nature's move but other players just knowing the probabilities and the fact that some players have observed the actual realized values. This relies on assuming that all players know the structure of the game, which means they all have \"common priors\", knowing the probabilities Nature uses in selecting parameters values, an assumption known as the Harsanyi Doctrine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>From 1966 to 1968, Harsanyi was part of a team of game theorists tasked with advising the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in collaboration with Mathematica, a consulting group from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Princeton_University\" title=\"Princeton University\">Princeton University<\/a> led by Harold Kuhn and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oskar_Morgenstern\" title=\"Oskar Morgenstern\">Oskar Morgenstern<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-nobelbio_6-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-nobelbio-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-weymark_7-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-weymark-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>John Harsanyi died on August 9, 2000, from a heart attack in Berkeley, California, after developing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Alzheimer%27s_disease\" title=\"Alzheimer's disease\">Alzheimer's disease<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-weymark_7-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-weymark-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>On 29 May 2010, Google celebrated John Hars\u00e1nyi's Birthday with a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Google_doodle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Google doodle\">doodle<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Harsanyi began researching <a href=\"\/wiki\/Utilitarianism\" title=\"Utilitarianism\">utilitarian ethics<\/a> in the mid-fifties at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Queensland\" title=\"University of Queensland\">University of Queensland<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Brisbane\" title=\"Brisbane\">Brisbane<\/a>.

When Kandel joined the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the US <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_Institutes_of_Health\" title=\"National Institutes of Health\">National Institutes of Health<\/a> in 1957, <a href=\"\/wiki\/William_Beecher_Scoville\" title=\"William Beecher Scoville\">William Beecher Scoville<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Brenda_Milner\" title=\"Brenda Milner\">Brenda Milner<\/a> had recently described the patient <a href=\"\/wiki\/HM_(patient)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"HM (patient)\">HM<\/a>, who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hippocampus\" title=\"Hippocampus\">hippocampus<\/a>. Kandel took on the task of performing electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pyramidal_neuron\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pyramidal neuron\">pyramidal neurons<\/a>. Working with Alden Spencer, he found electrophysiological evidence for action potentials in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dendrite\" title=\"Dendrite\">dendritic<\/a> trees of hippocampal neurons. The team also noticed the spontaneous pacemaker-like activity of these neurons, as well as a robust recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus. They provided the first intracellular records of the electrical activity that underlies the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Epilepsy\" title=\"Epilepsy\">epileptic<\/a> spike (the intracellular <a href=\"\/wiki\/Paroxysmal_depolarizing_shift\" title=\"Paroxysmal depolarizing shift\">paroxysmal depolarizing shift<\/a>) and the epileptic runs of spikes (the intracellular sustained depolarization). But, with respect to memory, there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage.\n<\/p><p>Kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Synapse\" title=\"Synapse\">synaptic<\/a> connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses. Kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior, such as those by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Konrad_Lorenz\" title=\"Konrad Lorenz\">Konrad Lorenz<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Niko_Tinbergen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Niko Tinbergen\">Niko Tinbergen<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Karl_von_Frisch\" title=\"Karl von Frisch\">Karl von Frisch<\/a> had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals.

Working with Irving Kupferman and Harold Pinsker, he developed protocols for demonstrating simple forms of learning by intact <i>Aplysia<\/i>. In particular, the researchers showed that the now famous <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aplysia_gill_and_siphon_withdrawal_reflex\" title=\"Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex\">gill-withdrawal reflex<\/a>, by which the slug protects its tender gill tissue from danger, was sensitive to both habituation and sensitization.

By this time it was known that long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, involved the synthesis of new proteins. By 1972 they had evidence that the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_messenger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Second messenger\">second messenger<\/a> molecule <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cyclic_AMP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cyclic AMP\">cyclic AMP<\/a> (cAMP) was produced in <i>Aplysia<\/i> ganglia under conditions that cause short-term memory formation (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Sensitization\" title=\"Sensitization\">sensitization<\/a>). In 1974 Kandel moved his lab to Columbia University and became founding director of the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. It was soon found that the neurotransmitter <a href=\"\/wiki\/Serotonin\" title=\"Serotonin\">serotonin<\/a>, acting to produce the second messenger cAMP, is involved in the molecular basis of sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex. By 1980, collaboration with Paul Greengard resulted in demonstration that <a href=\"\/wiki\/CAMP-dependent_protein_kinase\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"CAMP-dependent protein kinase\">cAMP-dependent protein kinase<\/a>, also known as protein kinase A (PKA), acted in this biochemical pathway in response to elevated levels of cAMP. Steven Siegelbaum identified a potassium channel that could be regulated by PKA, coupling serotonin's effects to altered synaptic electrophysiology.\n<\/p><p>In 1983 Kandel helped form the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute\" title=\"Howard Hughes Medical Institute\">Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute<\/a> at Columbia devoted to molecular neural science. The Kandel lab then sought to identify proteins that had to be synthesized to convert short-term memories into long-lasting memories. One of the nuclear targets for PKA is the transcriptional control protein <a href=\"\/wiki\/CREB\" title=\"CREB\">CREB<\/a> (cAMP response element binding protein).<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> In collaboration with <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=David_Glanzman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"David Glanzman (page does not exist)\">David Glanzman<\/a> and Craig Bailey, Kandel identified CREB as being a protein involved in long-term memory storage.

His parents weren't married, and due to the chaos in Europe caused by <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">World War II<\/a>, the story of his early life is remarkable, but the details are unclear.

Infections are first resisted by innate immunity, followed by adaptive immunity, which has memory, so can prevent reinfection. Two questions that immunologists ask: 1) By what mechanisms do innate and adaptive resistance come about? 2) How do these mechanisms contribute to other fields of medicine such as cancer, allergy, autoimmunity, etc.?\nIn the 20th century,  two theories arose: 1) Macrophages contribute to innate resistance through phagocytosis and intracellular killing 2) Antibodies mediate adaptive resistance by neutralizing microbial toxins. \nSteinman discovered that dendritic cells link innate to adaptive immunity, including adaptive T cell-mediated immunity.\n<\/p><p>He studied the initiation of antibody responses in tissue culture in the laboratory. As shown, he found out that antigens, lymphocytes, and \"accessory cells\" together create immune responses. Accessory cells contain a new cell type with probing cell process or \"dendrites\". These cells proved to be the missing link between innate and adaptive immunity.\n<\/p><p>Several features were used to identify and purify dendritic cells from mouse spleen. Because dendritic cells were discovered among \"adherent\" accessory cells (i.e. those that attach to tissue culture surfaces), they had to be distinguished from macrophages, whose hallmarks were persistent phagocytosis and adherence to tissue culture surfaces. However, Steinman found that dendritic cells had a different morphology and expressed different molecules from macrophages. For example, they did not express FcR- receptors, but did express major components of the major histocompatibility complex II and did not adhere to surfaces or exploit phagocytosis. Macrophages, though, showed the opposite characteristics. The study was carried out in collaboration with Zanvil A. Cohn, who studied resistance to infectious diseases, especially the biology of macrophages.\n<\/p><p>Some general features of T cell responses that are initiated by dendritic cells (DCs):\n<\/p><p>DCs capture, process and present antigens: \n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/92c84f3dd281a9fe5f6efbc21fd69b2ee7f7c322.jpg"},{"link":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bruce_Beutler","name":"Bruce Beutler","year":2011,"category":"Physiology or Medicine","country":"United States","text":"Bruce Beutler , Physiology or Medicine, 2011","date_of_birth":"1957-12-29T00:00:00.000","date_of_death":null,"place_of_birth":"Chicago","place_of_death":null,"gender":"male","award_age":54,"born_in":null,"mini_bio":null,"bio_image":null},{"link":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peter_A._Diamond","name":"Peter A.

Briefly continuing work with Goldstein and Brown, S\u00fcdhof helped identify a DNA element in the LDL gene that produced <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sterol\" title=\"Sterol\">sterol<\/a> mediated end-product repression when inserted in a viral promoter. This domain, known as a sterol regulatory sequence, directly participates in the regulation of sterol biosynthesis. Sterols are a major class of biomolecule and critical for life. Important sterols in humans include <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cholesterol\" title=\"Cholesterol\">cholesterol<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Steroid_hormones\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Steroid hormones\">steroid hormones<\/a>. Discovery of sterol regulatory elements and LDL receptor function led to the subsequent development of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Statin\" title=\"Statin\">statin<\/a> derived cholesterol medications such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Atorvastatin\" title=\"Atorvastatin\">atorvastatin<\/a> (Lipitor)\u2014the top-selling branded pharmaceutical drug in the world in 2008.\n<\/p><p>S\u00fcdhof started his independent research career in neuroscience since 1986 and open the field of molecular neuroscience for synaptic transmission especially from the presynaptic nerve terminal perspective. Until S\u00fcdhof began his work, majority of neuroscience research was aimed at the postsynaptic neuron and its role in learning and memory. Indeed, Thomas S\u00fcdhof is credited with discovering much of the machinery mediating neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity in his 21 years at UT Southwestern. S\u00fcdhof began with the discovery of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Synaptotagmins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Synaptotagmins\">synaptotagmins<\/a> and their role in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. Synaptotagmin, a transmembrane protein found in neurosecretory vesicles, functions as a calcium sensor triggering vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Stimulation of a neuron results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. After binding calcium ion to a region in its cytosolic domain, vesicular synaptotagmin promotes quick or slow neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron via interaction with regulatory and fusion related proteins such as members of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/SNARE\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"SNARE\">SNARE<\/a> complex. S\u00fcdhof also discovered RIMs and Muncs (most notably Munc13 and Munc18), soluble proteins which aid in the fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles to the nerve cell membrane and play an important role in synaptic plasticity. In addition, S\u00fcdhof's research uncovered the role of many other proteins facilitating vesicle binding, fusion, and resultant neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron, including members of the SNARE complex: <a href=\"\/wiki\/Synaptobrevin\" title=\"Synaptobrevin\">synaptobrevin<\/a>, in the vesicular membrane, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Syntaxin\" title=\"Syntaxin\">syntaxin<\/a>, in the cell membrane, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/SNAP25\" title=\"SNAP25\">SNAP25<\/a>, which is tethered to the cytosolic side of the cell membrane via cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains and holds the complex of four helices together. S\u00fcdhof was also responsible for elucidating the action of tetanus and botulinum toxins, which selectively cleave synaptobrevin and SNAP25, respectively, inhibiting vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane.\n<\/p><p>A second influential contribution of S\u00fcdhof is on synapse formation and specifications. S\u00fcdhof discovered a number of key molecules in this process such as  <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neurexins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neurexins\">neurexins<\/a>, present on presynaptic neurons, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Neuroligins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Neuroligins\">neuroligins<\/a>, present on postsynaptic neurons, that come together to form a physical protein bridge across the synapse. The diversity in types of neurexins and neuroligins allows for a variety of unique binding opportunities between neurons and impart a specificity to synaptic connections. Additionally he also discovered or elucidated the important functions of SynCAM, Latrophilins etc. in synapse formation. In additional studies, S\u00fcdhof identified mutations in these proteins as a factor in inherited <a href=\"\/wiki\/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism<\/a>. S\u00fcdhof is striving to elucidate the mechanism by which neurexins and neuroligins locate each other to form the synapse, their transcriptional regulation, and control of their variability.\n<\/p><p>S\u00fcdhof currently continues his work on synapse formation, maintenance as well as synaptic releases in his laboratory at Stanford University. Additionally, together with <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Marius_Wernig&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Marius Wernig (page does not exist)\">Marius Wernig<\/a> at Stanford University, S\u00fcdhof developed induced neuronal cell technology where they can use human neuronal cells derived from patients or genetically engineered with defined mutations that linked to neuropsychiatric disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders. S\u00fcdhof's research has not only given the scientific community a great understanding of the processes underlying synaptic transmission and synapse formation, but has also advanced medical knowledge of mechanisms behind poorly understood diseases such as Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, and Autism. He is currently working with a diverse group of researchers at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute\" title=\"Howard Hughes Medical Institute\">Howard Hughes Medical Institute<\/a> to develop mouse models for mutants of synaptic genes.
