Pirandello's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tragedy\" title=\"Tragedy\">tragic<\/a> <a href=\"\/wiki\/Farce\" title=\"Farce\">farces<\/a> are often seen as forerunners of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Theatre_of_the_Absurd\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Theatre of the Absurd\">Theatre of the Absurd<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in an area called \"Caos\" (\"Chaos\" in Italian, but in Sicilian dialect lit. \"Trouser\", from the shape of a nearby ravine), near <a href=\"\/wiki\/Porto_Empedocle\" title=\"Porto Empedocle\">Porto Empedocle<\/a>, a poor suburb of Girgenti (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Agrigento\" title=\"Agrigento\">Agrigento<\/a>, a town in southern <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sicily\" title=\"Sicily\">Sicily<\/a>). His father, Stefano Pirandello, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sulphur\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sulphur\">sulphur<\/a> industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento. Both families, the Pirandellos and the Ricci Gramittos, were ferociously anti-<a href=\"\/wiki\/House_of_Bourbon\" title=\"House of Bourbon\">Bourbon<\/a> and actively participated in the struggle for unification and democracy (\"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Italian_unification\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Italian unification\">Il Risorgimento<\/a>\"). Stefano participated in the famous <a href=\"\/wiki\/Expedition_of_the_Thousand\" title=\"Expedition of the Thousand\">Expedition of the Thousand<\/a>, later following <a href=\"\/wiki\/Giuseppe_Garibaldi\" title=\"Giuseppe Garibaldi\">Garibaldi<\/a> all the way to the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Battle_of_Aspromonte\" title=\"Battle of Aspromonte\">battle of Aspromonte<\/a>, and Caterina, who had hardly reached the age of thirteen, was forced to accompany her father to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Malta\" title=\"Malta\">Malta<\/a>, where he had been sent into exile by the Bourbon <a href=\"\/wiki\/Monarchy\" title=\"Monarchy\">monarchy<\/a>. But the open participation in the Garibaldian cause and the strong sense of idealism of those early years were quickly transformed, above all in Caterina, into an angry and bitter disappointment with the new reality created by the unification. Pirandello would eventually assimilate this sense of betrayal and resentment and express it in several of his poems and in his novel <i>The Old and the Young<\/i>. It is also probable that this climate of disillusion inculcated in the young Luigi the sense of disproportion between ideals and reality which is recognizable in his essay on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Humorism\" title=\"Humorism\">humorism<\/a> (<i>L'Umorismo<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>Pirandello received his elementary education at home, but was much more fascinated by the fables and legends, somewhere between popular and magic, that his elderly servant Maria Stella used to recount to him than by anything scholastic or academic. By the age of twelve, he had already written his first tragedy. At the insistence of his father, he was registered at a technical school, but eventually switched to the study of the humanities at the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Gymnasium_(school)\" title=\"Gymnasium (school)\">ginnasio<\/a><\/i>, something which had always attracted him.\n<\/p><p>In 1880, the Pirandello family moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Palermo\" title=\"Palermo\">Palermo<\/a>. It was here, in the capital of Sicily, that Luigi completed his high school education. He also began reading omnivorously, focusing, above all, on 19th-century Italian poets such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Giosu%C3%A8_Carducci\" title=\"Giosu\u00e8 Carducci\">Giosu\u00e8 Carducci<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Arturo_Graf\" title=\"Arturo Graf\">Arturo Graf<\/a>. He then started writing his first poems and fell in love with his cousin Lina.\n<\/p><p>During this period, the first signs of serious differences arose between Luigi and his father; Luigi had discovered some notes revealing the existence of Stefano's extramarital relations. As a reaction to the ever-increasing distrust and disharmony that Luigi was developing toward his father, a man of a robust physique and crude manners, his attachment to his mother would continue growing to the point of profound veneration. This later expressed itself, after her death, in the moving pages of the novella <i>Colloqui con i personaggi<\/i> in 1915.\n<\/p><p>His romantic feelings for his cousin, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cousin_marriage\" title=\"Cousin marriage\">initially looked upon with disfavour<\/a>, were suddenly taken very seriously by Lina's family. They demanded that Luigi abandon his studies and dedicate himself to the sulphur business so that he could immediately marry her. In 1886, during a vacation from school, Luigi went to visit the sulphur mines of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Porto_Empedocle\" title=\"Porto Empedocle\">Porto Empedocle<\/a> and started working with his father. This experience was essential to him and would provide the basis for such stories as <i>Il Fumo<\/i>, <i>Ci\u00e0ula scopre la Luna<\/i> as well as some of the descriptions and background in the novel <i>The Old and the Young<\/i>. The marriage, which had seemed imminent, was postponed.\n<\/p><p>Pirandello then registered at the <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Palermo\" title=\"University of Palermo\">University of Palermo<\/a> in the departments of Law and of Letters. The campus at Palermo, and above all the Department of Law, was the centre in those years of the vast movement which would eventually evolve into the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fasci_Siciliani\" title=\"Fasci Siciliani\">Fasci Siciliani<\/a>. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with its leading ideologists: <a href=\"\/wiki\/Rosario_Garibaldi_Bosco\" title=\"Rosario Garibaldi Bosco\">Rosario Garibaldi Bosco<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Enrico_La_Loggia\" title=\"Enrico La Loggia\">Enrico La Loggia<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Giuseppe_De_Felice_Giuffrida\" title=\"Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida\">Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida<\/a> and <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Francesco_De_Luca&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Francesco De Luca (page does not exist)\">Francesco De Luca<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-bonghi_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-bonghi-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1887, having definitively chosen the Department of Letters, he moved to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Rome\" title=\"Rome\">Rome<\/a> in order to continue his studies. But the encounter with the city, centre of the struggle for unification to which the families of his parents had participated with generous enthusiasm, was disappointing and nothing close to what he had expected. \"When I arrived in Rome it was raining hard, it was night time and I felt like my heart was being crushed, but then I laughed like a man in the throes of desperation.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-tititudorancea_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tititudorancea-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Pirandello, who was an extremely sensitive moralist, finally had a chance to see for himself the irreducible decadence of the so-called heroes of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Risorgimento\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Risorgimento\">Risorgimento<\/a> in the person of his uncle Rocco, now a greying and exhausted functionary of the prefecture who provided him with temporary lodgings in Rome. The \"desperate laugh\",the only manifestation of revenge for the disappointment undergone, inspired the bitter verses of his first collection of poems, <i>Mal Giocondo<\/i> (1889). But not all was negative; this first visit to Rome provided him with the opportunity to assiduously visit the many theatres of the capital: Il Nazionale, Il Valle, il Manzoni. \"Oh the dramatic theatre! I will conquer it. I cannot enter into one without experiencing a strange sensation, an excitement of the blood through all my veins...\"\n<\/p><p>Because of a conflict with a Latin professor, he was forced to leave the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sapienza_University_of_Rome\" title=\"Sapienza University of Rome\">University of Rome<\/a> and went to <a href=\"\/wiki\/University_of_Bonn\" title=\"University of Bonn\">Bonn<\/a> with a letter of presentation from one of his other professors. The stay in Bonn, which lasted two years, was fervid with cultural life. He read the German romantics, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jean_Paul\" title=\"Jean Paul\">Jean Paul<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ludwig_Tieck\" title=\"Ludwig Tieck\">Tieck<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chamisso\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chamisso\">Chamisso<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Heinrich_Heine\" title=\"Heinrich Heine\">Heinrich Heine<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Goethe\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Goethe\">Goethe<\/a>. He began translating the <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Roman_Elegies\" title=\"Roman Elegies\">Roman Elegies<\/a><\/i> of Goethe, composed the <i>Elegie Boreali<\/i> in imitation of the style of the <i>Roman Elegies<\/i>, and he began to meditate on the topic of humorism by way of the works of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cecco_Angiolieri\" title=\"Cecco Angiolieri\">Cecco Angiolieri<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>In March 1891 he received his doctorate in Romance Philology<sup id=\"cite_ref-collier_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-collier-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup> with a dissertation on the dialect of Agrigento: <i>Sounds and Developments of Sounds in the Speech of Craperallis<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>After a brief sojourn in Sicily, during which the planned marriage with his cousin was finally called off, he returned to Rome, where he became friends with a group of writer-journalists including <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Ugo_Fleres&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Ugo Fleres (page does not exist)\">Ugo Fleres<\/a>, <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Tomaso_Gnoli&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Tomaso Gnoli (page does not exist)\">Tomaso Gnoli<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Giustino_Ferri\" title=\"Giustino Ferri\">Giustino Ferri<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Luigi_Capuana\" title=\"Luigi Capuana\">Luigi Capuana<\/a>. Capuana encouraged Pirandello to dedicate himself to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Narrative\" title=\"Narrative\">narrative writing<\/a>. In 1893 he wrote his first important work, <i>Marta Ajala<\/i>, which was published in 1901 as <i>l'Esclusa<\/i>. In 1894 he published his first collection of short stories, <i>Amori senza Amore<\/i>. He also married in 1894, choosing (on his father's suggestion) a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family of Agrigentine origin educated by the nuns of San Vincenzo: Maria Antonietta Portulano.\n<\/p><p>The first years of matrimony brought on in him a new fervour for his studies and writings: his encounters with his friends and the discussions on art continued, more vivacious and stimulating than ever, while his family life, despite the complete incomprehension of his wife with respect to the artistic vocation of her husband,<sup id=\"cite_ref-tititudorancea_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tititudorancea-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup> proceeded relatively tranquilly with the birth of two sons (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Stefano_Pirandello\" title=\"Stefano Pirandello\">Stefano<\/a> and Fausto) and a daughter (Rosalia \"Lietta\"). In the meantime, Pirandello intensified his collaborations with newspaper editors and other journalists in magazines such as <i>La Critica<\/i> and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/La_Tavola_Rotonda\" title=\"La Tavola Rotonda\">La Tavola Rotonda<\/a><\/i> in which he published, in 1895, the first part of the <i>Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>In 1897 he accepted an offer to teach Italian at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma, and in the magazine <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Il_Marzocco\" title=\"Il Marzocco\">Il Marzocco<\/a><\/i> he published several more pages of the <i>Dialogi<\/i>. In 1898, with Italo Falbo and Ugo Fleres, he founded the weekly <i>Ariel<\/i>, in which he published the one-act play <i>L'Epilogo<\/i> (later changed to <i>La Morsa<\/i>) and some novellas (La Scelta, Se...). The end of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th were a period of extreme productivity for Pirandello. In 1900, he published in <i>Il Marzocco<\/i> some of the most celebrated of his novellas (<i>Lumie di Sicilia<\/i>, <i>La Paura del Sonno<\/i>...) and, in 1901, the collection of poems <i>Zampogna<\/i>. In 1902 he published the first series of <i>Beffe della Morte e della Vita<\/i> and his second novel, <i>Il Turno<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>The year 1903 was fundamental to the life of Pirandello. The flooding of the sulphur mines of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Aragona\" title=\"Aragona\">Aragona<\/a>, in which his father Stefano had invested not only an enormous amount of his own capital but also Antonietta's <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dowry\" title=\"Dowry\">dowry<\/a>, precipitated the financial collapse of the family. Antonietta, after opening and reading the letter announcing the catastrophe, entered into a state of semi-<a href=\"\/wiki\/Catatonia\" title=\"Catatonia\">catatonia<\/a> and underwent such a psychological shock that her mental balance remained profoundly and irremediably shaken.\n<\/p><p>Pirandello, who had initially harboured thoughts of suicide, attempted to remedy the situation as best he could by increasing the number of his lessons in both Italian and German and asking for compensation from the magazines to which he had freely given away his writings and collaborations. In the magazine <i>New Anthology<\/i>, directed by G. Cena, meanwhile, the novel which Pirandello had been writing while in this horrible situation (watching over his mentally ill wife at night after an entire day spent at work) began appearing in episodes. The title was <i>Il Fu Mattia Pascal<\/i> (<i>The Late Mattia Pascal<\/i>). This novel contains many autobiographical elements that have been fantastically re-elaborated. It was an immediate and resounding success. Translated into German in 1905, this novel paved the way to the notoriety and fame which allowed Pirandello to publish with the more important firms such as Treves, with whom he published, in 1906, another collection of novellas <i>Erma Bifronte<\/i>. In 1908 he published a volume of essays entitled <i>Arte e Scienza<\/i> and the important essay <i>L'Umorismo<\/i>, in which he initiated the legendary debate with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Benedetto_Croce\" title=\"Benedetto Croce\">Benedetto Croce<\/a> that would continue with increasing bitterness and venom on both sides for many years.\n<\/p><p>In 1905 he took his wife to stay in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chianciano_Terme\" title=\"Chianciano Terme\">Chianciano Terme<\/a> together with their children where they stay there for two months in what the writer called the <i>village nestled on the windy hill<\/i> right in <i>opposite the <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Collegiata_di_San_Giovanni_Battista_(Chianciano_Terme)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Collegiata di San Giovanni Battista (Chianciano Terme) (page does not exist)\">Collegiata<\/a><\/i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> Two short stories contained in the book <i><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Short_stories_for_a_year&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Short stories for a year (page does not exist)\">Short stories for a year<\/a><\/i> are coveted in this country: <i><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Bitter_water&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Bitter water (page does not exist)\">Bitter water<\/a><\/i> and <i><a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Pallino_and_Mim%C3%AC&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pallino and Mim\u00ec (page does not exist)\">Pallino and Mim\u00ec<\/a><\/i>.\n<\/p><p>In 1909 the first part of <i>I Vecchi e I Giovani<\/i> was published in episodes. This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fasci_Siciliani\" title=\"Fasci Siciliani\">Fasci Siciliani<\/a> in the period from 1893 to 1894. When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that \"their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically.\" However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was acutely observed by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Leonardo_Sciascia\" title=\"Leonardo Sciascia\">Leonardo Sciascia<\/a>, \"he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy.\" Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal <i>Corriere della Sera<\/i> in which he published the novellas <i>Mondo di Carta<\/i> (<i>World of Paper<\/i>), <i>La Giara<\/i>, and, in 1910, <i>Non \u00e8 una cosa seria<\/i> and <i>Pensaci, Giacomino!<\/i> (<i>Think it over, Giacomino!<\/i>) At this point Pirandello's fame as a writer was continually increasing. His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent.\n<\/p><p>In 1911, while the publication of novellas and short stories continued, Pirandello finished his fourth novel, <i>Suo Marito<\/i>, republished posthumously (1941), and completely revised in the first four chapters, with the title <i>Giustino Roncella nato Boggi\u00f2lo<\/i>. During his life the author never republished this novel for reasons of discretion; within are implicit references to the writer <a href=\"\/wiki\/Grazia_Deledda\" title=\"Grazia Deledda\">Grazia Deledda<\/a>. But the work which absorbed most of his energies at this time was the collection of stories <i>La vendetta del cane<\/i>, <i>Quando s'\u00e8 capito il giuoco<\/i>, <i>Il treno ha fischiato<\/i>, <i>Filo d'aria<\/i> and <i>Berecche e la guerra<\/i>. They were all published from 1913 to 1914 and are all now considered classics of Italian literature.\n<\/p><p>As Italy entered the <a href=\"\/wiki\/World_War_I\" title=\"World War I\">First World War<\/a>, Pirandello's son <a href=\"\/wiki\/Stefano_Pirandello\" title=\"Stefano Pirandello\">Stefano<\/a> volunteered for service and was taken prisoner by the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Austria-Hungary\" title=\"Austria-Hungary\">Austro-Hungarians<\/a>. In 1916 the actor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Angelo_Musco_(actor)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Angelo Musco (actor)\">Angelo Musco<\/a> successfully recited the three-act comedy that the writer had extracted from the novella <i>Pensaci, Giacomino!<\/i> and the <i>pastoral<\/i> comedy <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Liol%C3%A0\" title=\"Liol\u00e0\">Liol\u00e0<\/a><\/i>.\n<\/p><p>In 1917 the collection of novellas <i>E domani Luned\u00ec<\/i> (<i>And Tomorrow, Monday...<\/i>) was published, but the year was mostly marked by important theatrical representations: <i>Cos\u00ec \u00e8 (se vi pare)<\/i> (<i>Right you are (if you think so)<\/i>), <i>A birrita cu' i ciancianeddi<\/i> and <i>Il Piacere dell'onest\u00e0<\/i> (<i>The Pleasure Of Honesty<\/i>). A year later, <i>Ma non \u00e8 una cosa seria<\/i> (<i>But It's Nothing Serious<\/i>) and <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Il_Gioco_delle_Parti\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Il Gioco delle Parti\">Il Gioco delle Parti<\/a><\/i> (<i>The Game of Roles<\/i>) were all produced on stage. Pirandello's son Stefano returned home when the war ended.\n<\/p><p>In 1919 Pirandello had his wife placed in an asylum.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup> The separation from his wife, despite her morbid jealousies and hallucinations, caused great suffering for Pirandello who, even as late as 1924, believed he could still properly care for her at home. She never left the asylum.\n<\/p><p>1920 was the year of comedies such as <i>Tutto per bene<\/i>, <i>Come prima meglio di prima<\/i>, and <i>La Signora Morli<\/i>. In 1921, the <i>Compagnia di <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dario_Niccodemi\" title=\"Dario Niccodemi\">Dario Niccodemi<\/a><\/i> staged, at the Valle di Roma, the play, <i>Sei Personaggi in Cerca d'Autore<\/i>, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Six_Characters_in_Search_of_an_Author\" title=\"Six Characters in Search of an Author\">Six Characters in Search of an Author<\/a><\/i>. It was a clamorous failure. The public divided into supporters and adversaries, the latter of whom shouted, \"Asylum, Asylum!\" The author, who was present at the performance with his daughter Lietta, left through a side exit to avoid the crowd of enemies. The same drama, however, was a great success when presented in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Milan\" title=\"Milan\">Milan<\/a>. In 1922 in Milan, <i>Enrico IV<\/i> was performed for the first time and was acclaimed universally as a success. Pirandello's international reputation was developing as well. The <i>Sei personaggi<\/i> was performed in London and New York.\n<\/p><p>Pirandello was an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Italian_nationalist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Italian nationalist\">Italian nationalist<\/a> and supported <a href=\"\/wiki\/Italian_fascism\" title=\"Italian fascism\">Italian fascism<\/a> in a moderate way. In 1924, he wrote a letter to <a href=\"\/wiki\/Benito_Mussolini\" title=\"Benito Mussolini\">Benito Mussolini<\/a> asking him to be accepted as a member of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/National_Fascist_Party\" title=\"National Fascist Party\">National Fascist Party<\/a>. In 1925 Pirandello, with the help of Mussolini, assumed the artistic direction and ownership of the <a href=\"\/w\/index.php?title=Teatro_d%27Arte_di_Roma&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Teatro d'Arte di Roma (page does not exist)\">Teatro d'Arte di Roma<\/a>, founded by the Gruppo degli Undici. He described himself as \"a Fascist because I am Italian.\" For his devotion to Mussolini, the satirical magazine <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Il_Becco_Giallo\" title=\"Il Becco Giallo\">Il Becco Giallo<\/a><\/i> used to call him <i>P. Randello<\/i> (<i>randello<\/i> in Italian means <a href=\"\/wiki\/Club_(weapon)\" title=\"Club (weapon)\">cudgel<\/a>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Chiesa1990p38_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Chiesa1990p38-8\">[8]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>He expressed publicly apolitical belief, saying \"I'm apolitical, I'm only a man in the world.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup> During these years, he had continuous conflicts with fascist leaders.

He then gave his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down as part of the 1935 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Oro_alla_Patria\" title=\"Oro alla Patria\">Oro alla Patria<\/a> (<i>Gold to the Fatherland<\/i>) campaign during the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War\" title=\"Second Italo-Ethiopian War\">Second Italo-Ethiopian War<\/a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Pirandello's conception of the theatre underwent a significant change at this point. The idea of the actor as an inevitable betrayer of the text, as in the <i>Sei Personaggi<\/i>, gave way to the identification of the actor with the character that they play. The company took their act throughout the major cities of Europe, and the Pirandellian repertoire became increasingly well known.

Pirandello inspired playwrights such as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Samuel_Beckett\" title=\"Samuel Beckett\">Samuel Beckett<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Harold_Pinter\" title=\"Harold Pinter\">Harold Pinter<\/a> to write plays that echo the themes of existential exploration and metaphysical questioning that he focused on in his works.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:02_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:02-22\">[22]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-:12_23-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-23\">[23]<\/a><\/sup> However, his influence goes beyond playwright; French philosopher <a href=\"\/wiki\/Jean-Paul_Sartre\" title=\"Jean-Paul Sartre\">Jean-Paul Sartre<\/a> was also heavily inspired by Pirandello's ideas to dive deep into one of the main pillars of his philosophy: <a href=\"\/wiki\/Existentialism\" title=\"Existentialism\">existentialism<\/a>. The playwrights's portrayal of fractured identities and the ambiguity of existence in his plays served as inspiration for\u00a0 Sartre's concepts of freedom, authenticity, and existential angst. Pirandello's character narratives and metaphysical themes not only aligned with but also enriched Sartre's philosophical discourses, creating a link between existential thought in both theater and philosophy, where each medium deepened and reflected upon the complexities and theories of the other. Thus, the dialogues between self and other, freedom and responsibility, authenticity and bad faith, found ground in the intersection of their respective domains. His legacy pushes further reflection into the complexities of characters, human consciousness, and identity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:22_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:22-24\">[24]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Pirandello's contributions to theater and philosophy provide a rich tapestry of existential themes interwoven with detailed character narratives. His thorough and insightful examinations of the intricacies of the human psyche and identity have left a mark that is palpable in contemporary theater and academic circles. This influence, while rooted in a specific historical context, manages to bridge the gap between past and present. The careful juxtaposition of simplicity and depth in his works not only invites but stimulates discourse, resonating deeply with modern artists, playwrights, and thinkers. As a result, discussions on existential concepts, identity, and the nature of reality continue to be enriched by Pirandello's foundational ideas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Nearly all of Pirandello's plays were translated into English by the actor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Robert_Rietti\" title=\"Robert Rietti\">Robert Rietti<\/a>.

She attended elementary school (the minimum required at the time) and was then educated by a private tutor (a guest of one of her relatives) and moved on to study literature on her own. It was during this time that she started displaying an interest in writing short novels, mostly inspired by the life of Sardinian peasants and their struggles. Her teacher encouraged her to submit her writing to a newspaper and, at age 13, her first story was published in a local journal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup> Some of Deledda's early works were published in the fashion magazine <i>L'ultima moda<\/i> between 1888 and 1889.

Her family wasn't particularly supportive of her desire to write.\n<\/p><p>Deledda's first novel, <i>Fiori di Sardegna<\/i> (Flowers of Sardinia) was published in 1892.

Around this time Deledda initiated a regular collaboration with newspapers and magazines, most notably <i>La Sardegna<\/i>, <i>Piccola Rivista<\/i> and <i>Nuova Antologia<\/i>.

One day she noticed that her beloved pet crow, Checca, was visibly irritated by the commotion, with people constantly coming in and out of the house. \"If Checca has had enough, so have I,\" Deledda was quoted as saying, and she returned to a more retired routine.\nThe events also put a strain on Deledda's extremely methodical writings schedule.

He soon made the announcement that the message was received at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Signal_Hill_(Newfoundland_and_Labrador)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)\">Signal Hill<\/a> in <a href=\"\/wiki\/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador\" title=\"St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador\">St. John's<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Newfoundland_and_Labrador\" title=\"Newfoundland and Labrador\">Newfoundland<\/a> (now part of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada<\/a>), on 12 December 1901, using a 500-foot (150\u00a0m) kite-supported antenna for reception \u2013 signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Poldhu\" title=\"Poldhu\">Poldhu<\/a>, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles (3,500\u00a0km). It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 metres (frequency \u2248 850\u00a0kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter <i>S<\/i>. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">[51]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">[52]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Feeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS <i>Philadelphia<\/i> sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced <a href=\"\/wiki\/Magnetic_detector\" title=\"Magnetic detector\">coherer-tape<\/a> reception up to 1,550 miles (2,490\u00a0km), and audio reception up to 2,100 miles (3,400\u00a0km). The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for <a href=\"\/wiki\/Medium_wave\" title=\"Medium wave\">medium wave<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Longwave\" title=\"Longwave\">longwave<\/a> transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres (miles), despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n<\/p><p>On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Glace_Bay\" title=\"Glace Bay\">Glace Bay<\/a>, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America.

In September 1946, she accepted a one-semester research fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis, which extended into a long-term position due to her groundbreaking work. Her collaboration with Viktor Hamburger was instrumental in furthering her research on nerve growth factor, and she held a significant academic role at the university for over three decades, shaping the future of neurobiology through her mentorship and research.\n<\/p><p>In September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Viktor_Hamburger\" title=\"Viktor Hamburger\">Viktor Hamburger<\/a> at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Washington_University_in_St._Louis\" title=\"Washington University in St. Louis\">Washington University in St. Louis<\/a>; he was interested in two of the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals.<sup id=\"cite_ref-beckerexhibits.wustl.edu_27-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-beckerexhibits.wustl.edu-27\">[27]<\/a><\/sup> After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years.

The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumour cells was surprising. When describing it, Montalcini said it is: \"like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones.\" The nerve growth produced by the tumour was unlike anything she had seen before \u2013 the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumour. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumour itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves. Her research led to the seminal publication \"In vitro experiments on the effects of mouse sarcomas 180 and 37 on the spinal and sympathetic ganglia of the chick embryo\" in 1954, which was a foundational work in identifying and understanding nerve growth factor (NGF). This discovery paved the way for future research in neurobiology and had profound implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases.\n<\/p><p>She was made a full professor in 1958.

The collider started running in 1981 and, in early 1983, an international team of more than 100 physicists headed by Rubbia and known as the UA1 Collaboration, detected the intermediate vector bosons, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/W_and_Z_bosons\" title=\"W and Z bosons\">W and Z bosons<\/a>, which had become a cornerstone of modern theories of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Elementary_particle_physics\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elementary particle physics\">elementary particle physics<\/a> long before this direct observation.

The weak force also plays a fundamental role in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nucleosynthesis\" title=\"Nucleosynthesis\">nucleosynthesis<\/a> of the elements, as studied in theories of stars evolution.  These particles have a mass almost 100 times greater than the proton. In 1984 Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer were awarded the Nobel Prize \"for their decisive contributions to the large project, which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z, communicators of weak interaction\".<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"These claims require citations (December 2022)\">citation needed<\/span><\/a><\/i>]<\/sup>\n<\/p><p>To achieve energies high enough to create these particles, Rubbia, together with David Cline and Peter McIntyre, proposed a radically new particle accelerator design. They proposed to use a beam of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Protons\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Protons\">protons<\/a> and a beam of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antiproton\" title=\"Antiproton\">antiprotons<\/a>, their <a href=\"\/wiki\/Antimatter\" title=\"Antimatter\">antimatter<\/a> twins, counter rotating in the vacuum pipe of the accelerator and colliding head-on. The idea of creating particles by colliding beams of more \"ordinary\" particles was not new: electron-positron and proton-proton colliders were already in use. However, by the late 1970s \/ early 1980s those could not approach the needed energies in the centre of mass to explore the W\/Z region predicted by theory. At those energies, protons colliding with anti-protons were the best candidates, but how to obtain sufficiently intense (and well-collimated) beams of anti-protons, which are normally produced impinging a beam of protons on a fixed target? Van den Meer had in the meantime developed the concept of \"stochastic cooling\", in which particles, like anti-protons could be kept in a circular array, and their beam divergence reduced progressively by sending signals to bending magnets downstream. Since decreasing the divergence of the beam meant to reduce transverse velocity or energy components, the suggestive term \"stochastic cooling\" was given to the scheme. The scheme could then be used to \"cool\" (to collimate) the anti-protons, which could thus be forced into a well-focused beam, suitable for acceleration to high energies, without losing too many anti-protons to collisions with the structure. Stochastic expresses the fact that signals to be taken resemble random noise, which was called \"Schottky noise\" when first encountered in vacuum tubes. Without van der Meer's technique, UA1 would never have had the sufficient high-intensity anti-protons it needed. Without Rubbia's realisation of its usefulness, stochastic cooling would have been the subject of a few publications and nothing else. Simon van de Meer developed and tested the technology in the proton Intersecting Storage Rings at CERN, but it is most effective on rather low intensity beams, such as the anti-protons which were prepared for use in the SPS when configured as a collider.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"These claims require citations (December 2022)\">citation needed<\/span><\/a><\/i>]<\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 1970, Rubbia was appointed Higgins Professor of Physics at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Harvard_University\" title=\"Harvard University\">Harvard University<\/a>, where he spent one semester per year for 18 years,<sup id=\"cite_ref-CVCR_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CVCR-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> while continuing his research activities at CERN.
