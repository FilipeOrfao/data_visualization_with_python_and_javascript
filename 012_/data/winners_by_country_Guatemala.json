In many of his works, he is known to have frequently used onomatopoeias, repetitions and symbolism, techniques which are also prevalent in pre-Columbian texts. His modern interpretation of the Mayan writing style later became his trademark.<sup id=\"cite_ref-77\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">[77]<\/a><\/sup> Asturias synthesized the liturgic diction found in the ancient <i>Popul Vuh<\/i> with colourful, exuberant vocabulary.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Guti\u00e9rrez,_p._112_76-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Guti%C3%A9rrez,_p._112-76\">[76]<\/a><\/sup> This unique style has been called \"tropical baroque\" (\"barroquismo tropical\") by scholar Lourdes Royano Guti\u00e9rrez in her analysis of his major works.<sup id=\"cite_ref-78\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-78\">[78]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In <i>Mulata de tal<\/i>, Asturias fuses surrealism with indigenous tradition in something called the \"great language\" (\"la gran lengua\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-Guti\u00e9rrez,_p._112_76-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Guti%C3%A9rrez,_p._112-76\">[76]<\/a><\/sup> In this Maya tradition, the people bestow magical power to certain words and phrases; similar to a witch's chant or curse. In his stories, Asturias restores this power to words and lets them speak for themselves: \"Los toros toronegros, los toros torobravos, los toros torotumbos, los torostorostoros\" (\"the bulls bullsblack, the bulls bullsbrave, the bulls bullsshake, the bullsbullsbulls\").<sup id=\"cite_ref-79\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-79\">[79]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Asturias uses a significant amount of Mayan vocabulary in his works.
