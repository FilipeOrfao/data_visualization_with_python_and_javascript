Werner proposed the structure <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cobalt(III)_hexammine_chloride\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cobalt(III) hexammine chloride\">[Co(NH<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>6<\/sub>]Cl<sub>3<\/sub><\/a>, with the Co<sup>3+<\/sup> ion surrounded by six NH<sub>3<\/sub> at the vertices of an octahedron. The three Cl<sup>\u2212<\/sup> are dissociated as free ions, which Werner confirmed by measuring the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Conductivity_(electrolytic)\" title=\"Conductivity (electrolytic)\">conductivity<\/a> of the compound in an aqueous solution, and also by chloride anion analysis using precipitation with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Silver_nitrate\" title=\"Silver nitrate\">silver nitrate<\/a>. Later, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Magnetic_susceptibility\" title=\"Magnetic susceptibility\">magnetic susceptibility<\/a> analysis was also used to confirm Werner's proposal for the chemical nature of CoCl<sub>3<\/sub>\u20226NH<sub>3<\/sub>.\n<\/p><p>For complexes with more than one type of ligand, Werner succeeded in explaining the number of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Isomers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Isomers\">isomers<\/a> observed. For example, he explained the existence of two tetramine isomers, \"Co(NH<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>4<\/sub>Cl<sub>3<\/sub>\", one green and one purple. Werner proposed that these are two <a href=\"\/wiki\/Octahedral_molecular_geometry#Isomerism\" title=\"Octahedral molecular geometry\">geometric isomers<\/a> of formula [Co(NH<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>4<\/sub>Cl<sub>2<\/sub>]Cl, with one Cl<sup>\u2212<\/sup> ion dissociated as confirmed by conductivity measurements. The Co atom is surrounded by four NH<sub>3<\/sub> and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices.\n<\/p><p>Werner also prepared complexes with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Optical_isomers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Optical isomers\">optical isomers<\/a>, and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chirality_(chemistry)\" title=\"Chirality (chemistry)\">chiral<\/a> compound lacking carbon, known as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hexol\" title=\"Hexol\">hexol<\/a> with formula [Co(Co(NH<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>4<\/sub>(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>)<sub>3<\/sub>]Br<sub>6<\/sub>.\n<\/p><p>Before Werner, chemists defined the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Valence_(chemistry)\" title=\"Valence (chemistry)\">valence<\/a> of an element as the number of its bonds without distinguishing different types of bonds. However, in complexes such as [Co(NH<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>6<\/sub>]Cl<sub>3<\/sub> for example, Werner considered that the Co-Cl bonds correspond to a \"primary\" valence of 3 at long distance, while the Co-NH<sub>3<\/sub> bonds which correspond to a \"secondary\" or weaker valence of 6 at shorter length. This secondary valence of 6 he referred to as the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Coordination_number\" title=\"Coordination number\">coordination number<\/a> which he defined as the number of molecules (here of NH<sub>3<\/sub>) directly linked to the central metal atom. In other complexes, he found coordination numbers of 4 or 8.\n<\/p><p>On these views, and other similar views, in 1904 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Richard_Abegg\" title=\"Richard Abegg\">Richard Abegg<\/a> formulated what is now known as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Abegg%27s_rule\" title=\"Abegg's rule\">Abegg's rule<\/a> which states that the difference between the maximum positive and negative <a href=\"\/wiki\/Valence_(chemistry)\" title=\"Valence (chemistry)\">valence<\/a> of an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Chemical_element\" title=\"Chemical element\">element<\/a> is frequently eight.

The fictional town of Gerbersau is pseudonymous for Calw, imitating the real name of the nearby town of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hirsau\" title=\"Hirsau\">Hirsau<\/a>.

The pupils lived and studied at the abbey, one of Germany's most beautiful and well-preserved, attending 41 hours of classes a week. Although Hesse did well during the first months, writing in a letter that he particularly enjoyed writing essays and translating classic Greek poetry into German, his time in Maulbronn was the beginning of a serious personal crisis.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]<\/a><\/sup> In March 1892, Hesse showed his rebellious character, and, in one instance, he fled from the Seminary and was found in a field a day later. Hesse began a journey through various institutions and schools and experienced intense conflicts with his parents.

In 1893, he passed the One Year Examination, which concluded his schooling.

Then, in the early summer of 1894, he began a 14-month mechanic apprenticeship at a clock tower factory in Calw. The monotony of soldering and filing work made him turn himself toward more spiritual activities. In October 1895, he was ready to begin wholeheartedly a new apprenticeship with a bookseller in <a href=\"\/wiki\/T%C3%BCbingen\" title=\"T\u00fcbingen\">T\u00fcbingen<\/a>.

At the same time, Basel offered the solitary Hesse many opportunities for withdrawal into a private life of artistic self-exploration, journeys and wanderings. In 1900, Hesse was exempted from compulsory military service due to an <a href=\"\/wiki\/Amblyopia\" title=\"Amblyopia\">eye condition<\/a>.

In Gaienhofen, he wrote his second novel, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Beneath_the_Wheel\" title=\"Beneath the Wheel\">Beneath the Wheel<\/a><\/i>, which was published in 1906. In the following time, he composed primarily short stories and poems.

Gaienhofen was the place where Hesse's interest in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Buddhism\" title=\"Buddhism\">Buddhism<\/a> was re-sparked.
