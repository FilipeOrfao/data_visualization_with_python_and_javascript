            These two charts compare Nobel prize winners by country. The
            absolute numbers are compared to the per-capita measure which takes
            into account the population size of the respective countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low winning outliers with less than two prizes are removed from the
            relative set.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the absolute prize tally shows the expected dominance of the
            United States and historically influential countries, by adjusting
            for population size we see a very different, arguably fairer
            selection of achievements. Scandinavian countries do very well, as
            does Switzerland, a favorite of Nobel prize winning emigres. One
            caveat is that Sweden, winner by a relative metric, hosts the
            prize.

            This chart shows the cumulative Novel prize wins by region, taking
            the two or three highest winning countires from each. Note the huge
            increase in US prizes after the second World War and the point in
            the mid eighties when the US prize tally passed that of the old
            world, European nations.
