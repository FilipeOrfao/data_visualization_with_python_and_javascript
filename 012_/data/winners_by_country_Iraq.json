She was also instrumental in drafting and passing UN Security Council Resolution 2379. The resolution called for the creation of an Investigative Team, headed by a Special Advisor, to support domestic efforts to hold ISIL (Da'esh) accountable by collecting, preserving, and storing evidence in Iraq of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed by the terrorist group ISIL (Da'esh). \n<\/p><p>Murad's activism focused on accountability and gender equality in 2019, as she aided in the prosecution of an ISIL militant's wife in Germany and the collection of evidence of ISIL crimes. Murad worked with the German Mission to the UN to help draft and pass UN Security Council Resolution 2467 in April 2019. The resolution expands the UN's commitments to end sexual violence in conflict and emphasizes a survivor-centric approach to justice and accountability. Murad also took part in advocating for G7 member states to adopt legislation that protects and promotes women's rights as a member of France's Gender Advisory Council.\n<\/p><p>Murad urged the government of the Iraqi <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kurdistan_Region\" title=\"Kurdistan Region\">Kurdistan region<\/a> to play its role in rebuilding <a href=\"\/wiki\/Yazidis_in_Iraq\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Yazidis in Iraq\">Yazidi<\/a> areas in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Shingal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shingal\">Sinjar District<\/a> and returning the refugees back home. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nechirvan_Barzani\" title=\"Nechirvan Barzani\">Nechirvan Barzani<\/a> announced his full support \u201cto the humanitarian role she plays in service of peace and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Yazidis\" title=\"Yazidis\">Yazidi<\/a> victims,\u201d said the statement.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[30]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">[31]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 2019, Murad addressed the second annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]<\/a><\/sup> where she spoke about her story and the ongoing challenges faced by Yazidis nearly five years after the 3 August 2014 attacks.

The Code is a global consultative initiative aimed at building and supporting a community of better practice for, with, and concerning survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Its key objective is to respect and support survivors' rights, ensuring work with survivors to investigate, document, and record their experiences is safer, more ethical, and more effective in upholding their human rights.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">[37]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>On 6 February 2021, the Yazidi community buried 104 victims of the Kocho massacre, including two of Nadia's brothers and her mother. The ceremony was marked by both grief and closure, as many survivors were finally able to lay their family members to rest over six years after the genocide. It was also a visceral reminder of the urgent need to exhume all mass graves throughout Sinjar. In March 2021, the Iraqi Parliament passed the long-awaited Yazidi Female Survivors Law. The law formally acknowledges the Yazidi genocide and the gender-based trauma of sexual violence against Yazidi women and other ethnic minorities. It lays the groundwork for paying reparations, and guarantees land and job opportunities for survivors of ISIL captivity. Murad worked with Iraqi authorities and the Coalition for Just Reparations to draft and advocate for the law, as well as its ongoing implementation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">[38]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In May 2021, the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Crimes Committed by Da'esh\/ISIL (UNITAD) presented landmark findings to the UN Security Council. UNITAD's Special Advisor, Karim Khan, reported to the Security Council that \"there is clear and convincing evidence that the crimes against the Yazidi people clearly constituted genocide.\" Murad joined the proceedings to call on member states to establish international trials and support national efforts to prosecute ISIL members for their crimes of genocide and sexual violence.\n<\/p><p>In November 2021, a scheduled book club event in Canada with Nadia as a speaker was boycotted by the superintendent at the Toronto District School Board Helen Fisher, who declared the students from her school would not participate over fear of offending Islamic students and fostering Islamophobia. The move drew wide criticism, and the board was forced to clarify that these views were not their official position.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">[39]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In 2022, Murad, along with Nadia's Initiative, the Institute for International Criminal Investigation, and the UK government, released the Murad Code. She spoke about its benefits at the United Nations Security Council open debate on \"Accountability as Prevention: Ending Cycles of Sexual Violence in Conflict Open Debate on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence.\"\n<\/p><p>With her fellow 2018 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Dr. Denis Mukwege, Murad founded the Global Survivors Fund in October 2019. The Fund works to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence globally have access to reparations and other forms of redress.\n<\/p><p>The Global Survivors Fund (GSF) builds on the advocacy efforts of the Office of the United Nations' Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The UN Secretary-General endorsed GSF in a statement in April 2019, and Security Council Resolution 2467 referenced GSF.
