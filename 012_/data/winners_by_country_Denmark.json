He had discovered that a substance\u2019s anaesthetic action was related to its ability to dissolve in a layer of the lipid part of the plasma membrane, the anaesthetic molecules affected the opening of sodium channels which he assumed to be protein. This, he argued, would affect the movement of sodium ions and make nerve cells inexcitable, thus causing <a href=\"\/wiki\/Anaesthesia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anaesthesia\">anaesthesia<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Skou thought that other types of membrane protein might also be affected by local anaesthetics dissolving in the lipid part of the membrane. He therefore had the idea of looking at an enzyme which was embedded in the membrane and finding out if its properties were affected by local anaesthetics. He looked at <a href=\"\/wiki\/ATPase\" title=\"ATPase\">ATPase<\/a> in crab nerves.\n<\/p><p>The enzyme was there, but its activity was very variable and he needed a highly active enzyme for his studies. Eventually he managed to discover that ATPase was most active when exposed to the right combination of sodium, potassium and magnesium ions. Only then did he realise that this enzyme might have something to do with the active movement of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. This idea had been postulated many years before, however, the mechanism was quite unknown.\n<\/p><p>Skou published his findings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup> However, in his paper he was wary of identifying the enzyme with the active ion movement, so he left out the term \u201csodium-potassium pump\u201d from the title of his paper. Indeed, he seems to have realised the importance of his discovery only gradually, and he continued his studies on local anaesthetics.\n<\/p><p>In 1958 Skou went to a conference in Vienna to describe his work on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Cholinesterase\" title=\"Cholinesterase\">cholinesterase<\/a>. There he met Robert Post (born 1920<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>), who had been studying the pumping of sodium and potassium in red blood cells. Post had recently discovered that three sodium ions were pumped out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in, and in his research he had made use of a substance called <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ouabain\" title=\"Ouabain\">ouabain<\/a> (or g-strophanthin) which had recently been shown to inhibit the pump<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]<\/a><\/sup>).\n<\/p><p>Post had not read Skou\u2019s paper, but he was excited when Skou told him about his work with ATPase. Post asked whether the enzyme was inhibited by ouabain. At this stage Skou was unaware that ouabain inhibited the pump, but he immediately telephoned his lab and arranged for the experiment to be done. Ouabain did indeed inhibit the enzyme, thus establishing a link between the enzyme and the sodium-potassium pump.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Following the Nobel Prize, Skou gave several interviews recounting the story of his discoveries, and at age 94 was reported to still keep up with publications in his field.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]<\/a><\/sup> He died on 28 May 2018 in Aarhus, Denmark at the age of 99, less than five months shy of his 100th birthday.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/ce3b267003827f81675112dd4c36b8eac6a9087c.jpg"},{"link":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niels_Kaj_Jerne","name":"Niels Kaj Jerne","year":1984,"category":"Physiology or Medicine","country":"Denmark","text":"Niels Kaj Jerne ,  born in United Kingdom , Physiology or Medicine, 1984","date_of_birth":"1911-12-23T00:00:00.000","date_of_death":"1994-10-07T00:00:00.000","place_of_birth":"London","place_of_death":"Castillon-du-Gard","gender":"male","award_age":73,"born_in":null,"mini_bio":"<p><b>Niels Kaj Jerne<\/b>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society\" title=\"Fellow of the Royal Society\">FRS<\/a><sup id=\"cite_ref-frs_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-frs-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> (23 December 1911 \u2013 7 October 1994) was a Danish <a href=\"\/wiki\/Immunologist\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Immunologist\">immunologist<\/a>.

In a famous quote, Henrik Pontoppidan mocked the historic <a href=\"\/wiki\/Latinisation_(literature)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Latinisation (literature)\">latinisation<\/a> of his own surname Pontoppidan from its original Danish root <i>Broby.<\/i><sup id=\"cite_ref-e-poke.dk_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-e-poke.dk-2\">[2]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>In matter-of-fact short stories, he mercilessly describes the life of the peasants and country <a href=\"\/wiki\/Proletarian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Proletarian\">proletarians<\/a>, with whom he lived in close contact. He was perhaps the first Danish progressive writer to break with an idealised portrayal of farmers. The tales from this era are collected in <i>Landsbybilleder<\/i> (\"Village Pictures\", 1883) and <i>Fra Hytterne<\/i> (\"From the Huts\", 1887). An important part is his 1890 political collection of short stories <i>Skyer<\/i> (\"Clouds\"), a biting description of Denmark under the authoritarian semi-dictatorship of the Conservatives both condemning the oppressors and scorning the Danes\u2019 lack of disaffection. After this period he increasingly concentrated on psychological and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Naturalism_(literature)\" title=\"Naturalism (literature)\">naturalist<\/a> problems without giving up his social engagement. Pontoppidan's 1889 review \"Messias\" and 1890 piece \"Den gamle Adam\" were anonymously published and triggered a controversy after being denounced as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Blasphemy\" title=\"Blasphemy\">blasphemous<\/a>. The publisher, newspaper editor <a href=\"\/wiki\/Ernst_Immanuel_Cohen_Brandes\" title=\"Ernst Immanuel Cohen Brandes\">Ernst Brandes<\/a>, was fined 300 <a href=\"\/wiki\/Danish_Krone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Danish Krone\">kroner<\/a> for \"Messias\" in December 1891 and committed <a href=\"\/wiki\/Suicide\" title=\"Suicide\">suicide<\/a> in 1892.\n<\/p><p>His first wife was Mette Marie Hansen, a woman from a farming family in northern Zealand, with whom he had three children, one of whom died at a young age. The couple separated in 1889, after Pontoppidan met Antoinette Caroline Elise Kofoed. He married Kofoed in 1892, and they had a daughter and a son. Kofoed, who struggled with poor health, died in 1928. Pontoppidan had to provide for two families, which presented many difficulties. Both of his sons emigrated, one to the U.S. and one to Brazil.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>The three novels which are normally considered to be Pontoppidan's main works were written from about 1890 to 1920. In these works he established on his own terms a Danish version of the \"broad description of society\" novel in the tradition of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Balzac\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Balzac\">Balzac<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/%C3%89mile_Zola\" title=\"\u00c9mile Zola\">Zola<\/a>.

Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.\n<\/p><p>Between 1933 and 1943 Pontoppidan wrote two different versions of his <i>Memoirs<\/i>, in which he tried to define his own view of his personal development. Though handicapped by blindness and deafness in later life, he continued to take an interest in politics and cultural life until his final years.\n<\/p><p>As a stylist Pontoppidan has been described a born <a href=\"\/wiki\/Naturalism_(literature)\" title=\"Naturalism (literature)\">naturalist<\/a>.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

He often revised previous works, simplifying them but also changing their plot or sharpening their attitude.\n<\/p><p>In spite of being well known as a man of positions and attitudes Pontoppidan remains one of the most discussed modern Danish writers. This is partly because of his personal character. Pontoppidan was a man of many paradoxes: a clear liberal in his time, but a stern patriot, an anti-clerical puritan, a disillusioned fighting nature, collaborating with socialists but always from an independent and individualist position. But it is also partly due to his style which has often been regarded as ambiguous and impenetrable; his mixture of partiality and objectivity has often confused both readers and critics and in fact liberals, radicals, conservatives, right wingers and socialists have all tried to reflect their own ideals in his works. He has been regarded both as the absolute antagonist of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Georg_Brandes\" title=\"Georg Brandes\">Georg Brandes<\/a> and as his most congenial pupil.\n<\/p><p>Among all the authors of the Modern Break-Through, Pontoppidan is probably the most influential and longest living. His social critical writings mark him as a pioneer of 20th Century Danish literature. Cultural conservatives have been inspired by his critique of modernism after World War I. Finally, he set a standard of \"novels about society\" which remains relevant.
